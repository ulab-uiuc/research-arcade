Summary: Program synthesis has traditionally relied on human-provided specifications,
examples, or prior knowledge to generate functional algorithms. Existing
methods either emulate human-written algorithms or solve specific tasks without
generating reusable programmatic logic, limiting their ability to create novel
algorithms. We introduce AlgoPilot, a groundbreaking approach for fully
automated program synthesis without human-written programs or trajectories.
AlgoPilot leverages reinforcement learning (RL) guided by a Trajectory Language
Model (TLM) to synthesize algorithms from scratch. The TLM, trained on
trajectories generated by random Python functions, serves as a soft constraint
during the RL process, aligning generated sequences with patterns likely to
represent valid algorithms. Using sorting as a test case, AlgoPilot
demonstrates its ability to generate trajectories that are interpretable as
classical algorithms, such as Bubble Sort, while operating without prior
algorithmic knowledge. This work establishes a new paradigm for algorithm
discovery and lays the groundwork for future advancements in autonomous program
synthesis.
