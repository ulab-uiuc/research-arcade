Summary: The advancement of machine learning and the availability of large-scale
reaction datasets have accelerated the development of data-driven models for
computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) in the past decade. Here, we detail
the newest version of ASKCOS, an open source software suite for synthesis
planning that makes available several research advances in a freely available,
practical tool. Four one-step retrosynthesis models form the basis of both
interactive planning and automatic planning modes. Retrosynthetic planning is
complemented by other modules for feasibility assessment and pathway
evaluation, including reaction condition recommendation, reaction outcome
prediction, and auxiliary capabilities such as solubility prediction and
quantum mechanical descriptor prediction. ASKCOS has assisted hundreds of
medicinal, synthetic, and process chemists in their day-to-day tasks,
complementing expert decision making. It is our belief that CASP tools like
ASKCOS are an important part of modern chemistry research, and that they offer
ever-increasing utility and accessibility.
