Summary: This paper presents a new Large Language Model (LLM)-based Smart Device
Management framework, a pioneering approach designed to address the intricate
challenges of managing intelligent devices within public facilities, with a
particular emphasis on applications to libraries. Our framework leverages
state-of-the-art LLMs to analyze and predict device failures, thereby enhancing
operational efficiency and reliability. Through prototype validation in
real-world library settings, we demonstrate the framework's practical
applicability and its capacity to significantly reduce budgetary constraints on
public facilities. The advanced and innovative nature of our model is evident
from its successful implementation in prototype testing. We plan to extend the
framework's scope to include a wider array of public facilities and to
integrate it with cutting-edge cybersecurity technologies, such as Internet of
Things (IoT) security and machine learning algorithms for threat detection and
response. This will result in a comprehensive and proactive maintenance system
that not only bolsters the security of intelligent devices but also utilizes
machine learning for automated analysis and real-time threat mitigation. By
incorporating these advanced cybersecurity elements, our framework will be
well-positioned to tackle the dynamic challenges of modern public
infrastructure, ensuring robust protection against potential threats and
enabling facilities to anticipate and prevent failures, leading to substantial
cost savings and enhanced service quality.
