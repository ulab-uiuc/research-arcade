Summary: Effective evaluation of real-time strategy tasks requires adaptive mechanisms
to cope with dynamic and unpredictable environments. This study proposes a
method to improve evaluation functions for real-time responsiveness to
battle-field situation changes, utilizing an online reinforcement
learning-based dynam-ic weight adjustment mechanism within the real-time
strategy game. Building on traditional static evaluation functions, the method
employs gradient descent in online reinforcement learning to update weights
dynamically, incorporating weight decay techniques to ensure stability.
Additionally, the AdamW optimizer is integrated to adjust the learning rate and
decay rate of online reinforcement learning in real time, further reducing the
dependency on manual parameter tun-ing. Round-robin competition experiments
demonstrate that this method signifi-cantly enhances the application
effectiveness of the Lanchester combat model evaluation function, Simple
evaluation function, and Simple Sqrt evaluation function in planning algorithms
including IDABCD, IDRTMinimax, and Port-folio AI. The method achieves a notable
improvement in scores, with the en-hancement becoming more pronounced as the
map size increases. Furthermore, the increase in evaluation function
computation time induced by this method is kept below 6% for all evaluation
functions and planning algorithms. The pro-posed dynamic adaptive evaluation
function demonstrates a promising approach for real-time strategy task
evaluation.
