Summary: The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in
generative AI and large language models (LLMs), have profoundly impacted the
creative industries by enabling innovative content creation, enhancing
workflows, and democratizing access to creative tools. This paper explores the
significant technological shifts since our previous review in 2022,
highlighting how these developments have expanded creative opportunities and
efficiency. These technological advancements have enhanced the capabilities of
text-to-image, text-to-video, and multimodal generation technologies. In
particular, key breakthroughs in LLMs have established new benchmarks in
conversational AI, while advancements in image generators have revolutionized
content creation. We also discuss AI integration into post-production
workflows, which has significantly accelerated and refined traditional
processes. Despite these innovations, challenges remain, particularly for the
media industry, due to the demands on communication traffic from creative
content. We therefore include data compression and quality assessment in this
paper. Furthermore, we highlight the trend toward unified AI frameworks capable
of addressing multiple creative tasks and underscore the importance of human
oversight to mitigate AI-generated inaccuracies. Finally, we explore AI's
future potential in the creative sector, stressing the need to navigate
emerging challenges to maximize its benefits while addressing associated risks.
