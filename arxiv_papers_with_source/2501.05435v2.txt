Summary: Background: The field of Artificial Intelligence has undergone cyclical
periods of growth and decline, known as AI summers and winters. Currently, we
are in the third AI summer, characterized by significant advancements and
commercialization, particularly in the integration of Symbolic AI and
Sub-Symbolic AI, leading to the emergence of Neuro-Symbolic AI.
  Methods: The review followed the PRISMA methodology, utilizing databases such
as IEEE Explore, Google Scholar, arXiv, ACM, and SpringerLink. The inclusion
criteria targeted peer-reviewed papers published between 2020 and 2024. Papers
were screened for relevance to Neuro-Symbolic AI, with further inclusion based
on the availability of associated codebases to ensure reproducibility.
  Results: From an initial pool of 1,428 papers, 167 met the inclusion criteria
and were analyzed in detail. The majority of research efforts are concentrated
in the areas of learning and inference (63%), logic and reasoning (35%), and
knowledge representation (44%). Explainability and trustworthiness are less
represented (28%), with Meta-Cognition being the least explored area (5%). The
review identifies significant interdisciplinary opportunities, particularly in
integrating explainability and trustworthiness with other research areas.
  Conclusion: Neuro-Symbolic AI research has seen rapid growth since 2020, with
concentrated efforts in learning and inference. Significant gaps remain in
explainability, trustworthiness, and Meta-Cognition. Addressing these gaps
through interdisciplinary research will be crucial for advancing the field
towards more intelligent, reliable, and context-aware AI systems.
