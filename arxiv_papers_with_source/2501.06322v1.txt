Summary: With recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), Agentic AI has become
phenomenal in real-world applications, moving toward multiple LLM-based agents
to perceive, learn, reason, and act collaboratively. These LLM-based
Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) enable groups of intelligent agents to coordinate
and solve complex tasks collectively at scale, transitioning from isolated
models to collaboration-centric approaches. This work provides an extensive
survey of the collaborative aspect of MASs and introduces an extensible
framework to guide future research. Our framework characterizes collaboration
mechanisms based on key dimensions: actors (agents involved), types (e.g.,
cooperation, competition, or coopetition), structures (e.g., peer-to-peer,
centralized, or distributed), strategies (e.g., role-based or model-based), and
coordination protocols. Through a review of existing methodologies, our
findings serve as a foundation for demystifying and advancing LLM-based MASs
toward more intelligent and collaborative solutions for complex, real-world use
cases. In addition, various applications of MASs across diverse domains,
including 5G/6G networks, Industry 5.0, question answering, and social and
cultural settings, are also investigated, demonstrating their wider adoption
and broader impacts. Finally, we identify key lessons learned, open challenges,
and potential research directions of MASs towards artificial collective
intelligence.
