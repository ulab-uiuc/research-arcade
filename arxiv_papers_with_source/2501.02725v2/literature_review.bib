abstract = "In the history of the quest for human-level artificial intelligence, a number of rival paradigms have vied for supremacy. Symbolic artificial intelligence was dominant for much of the 20th century, but currently a connectionist paradigm is in the ascendant, namely machine learning with deep neural networks. However, both paradigms have strengths and weaknesses, and a significant challenge for the field today is to effect a reconciliation. A central tenet of the symbolic paradigm is that intelligence results from the manipulation of abstract compositional representations whose elements stand for objects and relations. If this is correct, then a key objective for deep learning is to develop architectures capable of discovering objects and relations in raw data, and learning how to represent them in ways that are useful for downstream processing. This short review highlights recent progress in this direction."

  abstract = 	 {Restoring degraded underwater images is a challenging ill-posed problem. Existing priors-based approaches have limited performance in many situations due to their hand-designed features. In this paper, we propose an effective convolutional neural network (CNN) based approach for underwater image restoration, which consists of a transmission estimation network (T-network) and a global ambient light estimation network (A-network). By learning the relationship between the underwater scenes and their corresponding blue channel transmission map and global ambient light respectively, we can recover and enhance the underwater images with an underwater optical imaging model. In T-network, we use cross-layer connection and multi-scale estimation to prevent halo artifacts and to preserve edge features. Moreover, we develop a new underwater image synthetic method for training, which can simulate underwater images captured in various underwater environments. Experimental results of synthetic and real images demonstrate that our restored underwater images exhibits more natural color correction and better visibility improvement against these state-of-the-art methods.}

  Abstract                 = {Ground truth optical flow is difficult to measure in real scenes with natural motion. As a result, optical flow data sets are restricted in terms of size, complexity, and diversity, making optical flow algorithms difficult to train and test on realistic data. We introduce a new optical flow data set derived from the open source {3D} animated short film Sintel. This data set has important features not present in the popular Middlebury flow evaluation: long sequences, large motions, specular reflections, motion blur, defocus blur, and atmospheric effects. Because the graphics data that generated the movie is open source, we are able to render scenes under conditions of varying complexity to evaluate where existing flow algorithms fail. We evaluate several recent optical flow algorithms and find that current highly-ranked methods on the Middlebury evaluation have difficulty with this more complex data set suggesting further research on optical flow estimation is needed. To validate the use of synthetic data, we compare the image- and flow-statistics of Sintel to those of real films and videos and show that they are similar. The data set, metrics, and evaluation website are publicly available.},

  Abstract                 = {This work introduces a novel convolutional network architecture for the task of human pose estimation. Features are processed across all scales and consolidated to best capture the various spatial relationships associated with the body. We show how repeated bottom-up, top-down processing used in conjunction with intermediate supervision is critical to improving the performance of the network. We refer to the architecture as a ``stacked hourglass'' network based on the successive steps of pooling and upsampling that are done to produce a final set of predictions. State-of-the-art results are achieved on the FLIC and MPII benchmarks outcompeting all recent methods.},

  Abstract                 = {Optical full-field measurement methods such as Digital Image Correlation (DIC) provide a new opportunity for measuring deformations and vibrations with high spatial and temporal resolution. However, application to full-scale wind turbines is not trivial. Elaborate preparation of the experiment is vital and sophisticated post processing of the DIC results essential. In the present study, a rotor blade of a 3.2 MW wind turbine is equipped with a random black-and-white dot pattern at four different radial positions. Two cameras are located in front of the wind turbine and the response of the rotor blade is monitored using DIC for different turbine operations. In addition, a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) system is used in order to measure the wind conditions. Wind fields are created based on the LiDAR measurements and used to perform aeroelastic simulations of the wind turbine by means of advanced multibody codes. The results from the optical DIC system appear plausible when checked against common and expected results. In addition, the comparison of relative out-ofplane blade deflections shows good agreement between DIC results and aeroelastic simulations.},
