	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) in general and chatbots in particular have emerged as significant investments in the healthcare sector in Vietnam, notably at Hanoi Medical University Hospital. The integration of virtual assistants to provide information for patients at Hanoi Medical University Hospital can alleviate the burden on human resources and facilitate the hospital’s transition toward a futuristic healthcare facility. This study employs Large Language Models, specifically the gpt-3.5-turbo model from OpenAI, to construct a chatbot capable of answering user queries about the prices of various services offered at the hospital. The chatbot undergoes fine-tuning using a dataset comprising predefined questions and answers from the hospital. The study also utilizes similarity metrics such as Jaccard similarity to evaluate the accuracy of the chatbot. After three rounds of fine-tuning, with each dataset subjected to data augmentation and three epochs run per fine-tuning iteration, the accuracy of the chatbot has improved significantly from 63% to 82%, culminating in an impressive 96%. However, being a data-hungry model, the development of the chatbot encounters challenges due to the limited dataset available at the hospital. This study highlights the substantial improvement in the chatbot’s performance through iterative fine-tuning and data augmentation. Nonetheless, evaluating the model’s accuracy remains challenging with the current limited dataset. Future developments may involve incorporating additional evaluation metrics, such as direct user feedback from chatlogs, to enhance the assessment of the chatbot and further refine it for user deployment. The study provides insights into the promising potential of AI-driven chatbots in transforming healthcare information delivery, emphasizing the importance of ongoing enhancements and user-centric evaluations in optimizing their functionality. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.}

	pages = {29 – 36},
	abstract = {Intent-Based Networking (IBN) management has emerged as an alternative approach to simplify network configuration and management by abstracting the complexities of low-level configurations. Existing IBN solutions typically rely on human-readable structures like JSON or YAML to define Intents, which still require expertise in understanding these structures. A natural evolution of IBN is to use natural language instead of defined structures. However, this approach introduces complexities related to natural language understanding. Fortunately, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution. In this paper: (i) We propose a novel LLM-centric Intent Life-Cycle (LC) management architecture designed to configure and manage network services using natural language. The architecture spans the complete Intent LC, encompassing decomposition, translation, negotiation, activation, and assurance; (ii) We identify key open issues and challenges related to IBN within our proposed architecture; (iii) We demonstrate the effectiveness of the architecture by developing a component within the EURECOM 5G facility [1], leveraging LLMs to implement the essential Intent LC procedures; (iv) We validate the proposed system through realworld deployment, showcasing its capability to define, decompose, translate, and activate Intents using natural language. © 1986-2012 IEEE.}

	year = {2024},
	journal = {Sustainable Cities and Society},
	volume = {117},
	abstract = {Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are anticipated to revolutionize future transportation, necessitating updates to traffic infrastructure, particularly parking facilities, due to the unique characteristics of AVs compared to Human-Driven Vehicles (HDVs). During the transition period in which AVs and HDVs coexist, adaptable infrastructure is essential to accommodate both vehicle types. Traditional research, typically reliant on complex mathematical models and simulations, faces challenges in adapting to diverse urban settings, requiring substantial time and resources. To address these challenges, a government-level framework was developed, enabling urban planners to quickly and accurately evaluate and optimize existing parking facilities for future AV and HDV coexistence scenarios. The framework integrates a Large Language Model (LLM) to enhance flexibility and efficiency in parking planning throughout the transitional period. Structured guidance is incorporated to enhance decision-making precision and reduce LLM hallucination risks. The flexibility, robustness, and accuracy of the framework were validated through step-by-step and end-to-end testing using real-world datasets. Specifically, the framework achieved 91.1 % comprehensiveness and 70.2 % consistency in Indicator Selection Module testing, a 68.9 % success rate in the Single Indicator Calculation Module, and a 66.7 % success rate in end-to-end testing, demonstrating its practical value in supporting cities during AV integration. Finally, the success rates of different LLM agent modules were further explored, along with a comparison of multiple LLMs and an analysis of key issues related to LLM trustworthiness in urban planning applications. The research highlights the potential of LLMs in advancing urban planning processes and optimizing existing infrastructure, contributing to smarter and more adaptable urban environments. © 2024}

	volume = {13},
	number = {1},
	abstract = {The collection and use of personal data are becoming more common in today’s data-driven culture. While there are many advantages to this, including better decision-making and service delivery, it also poses significant ethical issues around confidentiality and privacy. Text anonymisation tries to prune and/or mask identifiable information from a text while keeping the remaining content intact to alleviate privacy concerns. Text anonymisation is especially important in industries like healthcare, law, as well as research, where sensitive and personal information is collected, processed, and exchanged under high legal and ethical standards. Although text anonymisation is widely adopted in practice, it continues to face considerable challenges. The most significant challenge is striking a balance between removing information to protect individuals’ privacy while maintaining the text’s usability for future purposes. The question is whether these anonymisation methods sufficiently reduce the risk of re-identification, in which an individual can be identified based on the remaining information in the text. In this work, we challenge the effectiveness of these methods and how we perceive identifiers. We assess the efficacy of these methods against the elephant in the room, the use of AI over big data. While most of the research is focused on identifying and removing personal information, there is limited discussion on whether the remaining information is sufficient to deanonymise individuals and, more precisely, who can do it. To this end, we conduct an experiment using GPT over anonymised texts of famous people to determine whether such trained networks can deanonymise them. The latter allows us to revise these methods and introduce a novel methodology that employs Large Language Models to improve the anonymity of texts. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.}

	abstract = {It is likely that individuals are turning to Large Language Models (LLMs) to seek health advice, much like searching for diagnoses on Google. We evaluate clinical accuracy of GPT-3·5 and GPT-4 for suggesting initial diagnosis, examination steps and treatment of 110 medical cases across diverse clinical disciplines. Moreover, two model configurations of the Llama 2 open source LLMs are assessed in a sub-study. For benchmarking the diagnostic task, we conduct a naïve Google search for comparison. Overall, GPT-4 performed best with superior performances over GPT-3·5 considering diagnosis and examination and superior performance over Google for diagnosis. Except for treatment, better performance on frequent vs rare diseases is evident for all three approaches. The sub-study indicates slightly lower performances for Llama models. In conclusion, the commercial LLMs show growing potential for medical question answering in two successive major releases. However, some weaknesses underscore the need for robust and regulated AI models in health care. Open source LLMs can be a viable option to address specific needs regarding data privacy and transparency of training. © The Author(s) 2024.}

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is a promising distributed learning mechanism that revolutionizes our interaction with data in the IoT ecosystem. Due to the rapidly growing scale of smart devices and the limited transmission resources of networks, a simple, consistent, and scalable FL framework aiming to address the communication bottleneck is urgently needed. In this work, we propose an efficient approach with selective aggregation of models (SAMs) to mitigate the communication overload in FL systems. The introduction of SAM enables each local client to upload its model with a certain probability, resulting in a significant reduction in costly communication expenses. We design the algorithm for SAM, analyze the convergence bound on nonconvex objectives for heterogeneous data, which illustrates the impact of the selection probability as well as the set size of participating clients on the system performance, and assess the conservation for the network resource utilization by modeling queuing systems. We conduct various experiments to evaluate the performance of SAM, whose outcomes suggest that significant alleviation of the communication bottleneck can be accomplished with marginal cost of performance loss. It will also be shown that SAM is a communication-efficient method that can be freely applied to other frameworks.  © 2014 IEEE.}

	pages = {68 – 76},
	abstract = {Smart buildings integrate users’ digitized wearables with their physical surroundings, creating a seamless and interactive user experience. This is achieved through the utilization of multiple sensors, video streaming, artificial intelligence, and edge computing. These technologies gather extensive data and provide users with a wide range of applications, such as 3D audio/video in AR/VR, localization, virtual tours, and vigilant monitoring. Nevertheless, the current AR/VR devices face limitations due to the bulkiness and discomfort of the hardware used for on-body sensing, such as headsets and specialized glasses. These components often become uncomfortable during prolonged usage, posing a challenge for creating an immersive system that combines lightweight interaction with high-quality presentation. This paper presents a comprehensive system designed to enable immersive interaction in smart buildings with a focus on lightweight solutions. The system consists of the following components: (1). A lightweight panoramic imaging framework to address the challenges related to hardware size and functionality. (2). A learning-based video transcoding cost prediction framework for efficient load balancing. (3). A layered networking architecture designed to facilitate high-quality mobile panorama live streaming. Collectively, these components offer lightweight interaction paired with enhanced presentation quality. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the system design, showcasing its seamless operation across different times, geographical locations, and heterogeneous wireless networks. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.}

Nowadays, IoT smart devices have drawn increasing attention for collaborative learning tasks, e.g., persistent monitoring and online recognition. In this article, we present an adaptive compact deep neural network (DNN) approach (termed as AC-DNN) to tackle the challenging problem of unreliable transmission for collaborative learning tasks among heterogeneous smart devices. We introduce a cross-platform model weight encoding, decoding, and dispatching architecture to accommodate to differential smart devices and improve the reliability of intermediate model transmission via encapsulating binary model weights into self-contained transactions. To decrease encoding and decoding overhead, we design a quantile-based histogram sketch to compress the intermediate model. We conduct extensive evaluations to test our AC-DNN framework and deploy the AC-DNN on federated learning testbed FedAvg. We evaluate our approach functionality using different DNN architectures, such as convolutional neural network and ResNet and compare their effectiveness within the different network structures. The experiments reveal that our approach can improve the reliability of collaborative learning tasks among smart devices. Meanwhile, we can achieve nearly 70% weight compression compared to the original model size with minimal loss of accuracy. Our approach facilitates the deployment of a DNN-like network among discrete mobile smart devices for deep and persistent learning tasks.  © 2014 IEEE.}

	abstract = {Numerous sensors on smart devices have made it possible to automatically recognize human movement, which might be helpful for intelligent applications like elder care, smart homes, and health monitoring. Nevertheless, implementing an activity recognition model in practical situations faces two main obstacles. First, machine learning models use a large number of labeled data to recognize human activities, which is not always feasible in real scenarios. Second, existing human activity recognition (HAR) systems cannot dynamically adapt to a new action. Furthermore, current methods fail to separate short-term activities from heterogeneous smart devices with varying positions and orientations that have similar sensory reading patterns. To address these issues, we propose Flexi-HAMR, an intelligent adaptive human activity monitoring and recognition system that dynamically recognizes activities using online, real-time activity signals. Many empirical findings show that the suggested flexible activity recognition model performs competitively on multiindividual activity identification tasks and has a comparatively more vital generalization ability.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.}

Not only that it has the characteristics of a quick response, but it can also effectively reduce the burden of cloud computing. In addition, it can also extend the application of network edge through the coexistence and collaboration with the cloud system. However, with a large number of edge devices being deployed, the previous remote device management system will face the challenges of resource constraints and software firmware compatibility. In addition, implementing remote fault management, configuration management, accounting management, performance management, and security management through edge device management is a key task. Therefore, this study has designed and implemented a trusted edge device management system based on a microservice and a plug-and-play hardware management device. The running state of the edge device, the functions of remote device control, and system restart are monitored remotely by in- and out-of-band management modes. In addition, in terms of data transmission security, the design concept of a trusted platform module is introduced to realize data encryption and authentication, and ensure security and reliability. In this paper, the operational feasibility of management services based on containerized microservice in edge devices is verified with system benchmarking tools without affecting system performance. According to the experimental results, the proposed architecture in this study can be effective in edge device management. © 2023 KICS.}

Nevertheless, the research of the power device failure process is insufficient. In this article, an accurate and intelligent approach is proposed to predict the power device fatigue failure process with multiple fatigue sampling method (MFSM) and minimal component unit method (MCUM). The MFSM is proposed to accurately build the power device lifetime model. It is accomplished through the multiple sampling fatigue morphology evolution process of solder layers combined with the fatigue parameter. Morphology evolution is detected by scanning acoustic microscope technology under an accelerated lifetime test. The fatigue parameter is obtained through finite-element analysis (FEA) by establishing each sampling geometry model. Then, the lifetime model is determined by their same failure area fraction (Fs). In particular, digital image processing is applied to describe solder layer shapes in detail, which is also the key to building a real FEA geometry model. The MCUM is utilized to complete the prediction of failure process, where solder layers are divided into minimal units and the FEA solution and location information of each unit are known. Based on the lifetime model, the failure area can be determined and the fatigue failure process can be finished intelligently by cosimulation. The proposed method is accurate and intelligent enough in predicting the failure of solder layers, which is more helpful for planned device management.  © 1986-2012 IEEE.}

It is essential to consider the security requirements of the actual physical environment, rendering the traditional access control approach centered on the information space. In the IoT ecosystem, there are several issues such as the dynamics of devices frequently entering and leaving, the lack of computing and storage capacity, and distributed deployment. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Domain Attribute Based Access Control(DABAC) that incorporates domain elements to implement the physical location limitation of dynamic devices. Moreover, an intelligent gateway is utilized to divide the physical area and act as a proxy to achieve regional device management, automatic networking of devices in the domain, and the dynamic expansion of the sensor network resulting from device entry or exit. Then, given the distributed deployment of devices, smart contracts are employed to deploy access control mechanisms and construct a trusted environment to mitigate threats such as single points of failure. Finally, the DABAC is implemented on the Ethereum platform, simulating a smart medical situation. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution effectively addresses the problem of access control of device dynamics in an untrusted IoT environment while maintaining system security. © 2013 IEEE.}

	abstract = {A data collection infrastructure is vital for generating sufficient amounts and diversity of data necessary for developing algorithms in home-based health monitoring. However, the manageability - deployment and operation efforts - of such an infrastructure has long been overlooked. Even a small size of a dozen homes may incur enormous manual efforts on the research team. In this paper, we present Proteus, an easily managed infrastructure designed to automate much of the work in deploying and operating such systems. We develop new components and combine with mature technologies to minimize the human efforts required. Proteus includes: i) scalable, continuous deployment, operation and update of devices with automatic bootstrapping; ii) automatic fault and error monitoring and recovery with watchdogs and LED feedback, and complementary edge and cloud storage backups; and iii) an easy-to-use data-agnostic pipeline for integrating new modalities. We demonstrate our system's robustness through different sets of experiments: 3 sensor nodes running for 24 days sending data (17.4 Mbps aggregate rate), 10 sensor nodes for 14 days (58 Mbps aggregate rate), and 32 emulated sensors (419.2 Mbps aggregate rate). All such experiments have data loss rates less than 1%. Further we reduce human efforts by 25-fold and code required for adding new data modality by 25-fold. We also share our experience and lessons learned during the design, development, and pilot deployment of Proteus. Our results show that Proteus is a promising solution for enabling research teams to effectively manage home-based health monitoring at small to medium sizes.  © 2014 IEEE.}

This framework can dynamically provision the IoT devices to enable machine-to-machine (M2M) communication as well as continuous operational fault detection for WSNs. Unlike the existing approaches in the literature, SDIM is mainly deployed at multiaccess edge computing (MEC) nodes and is integrated with the cloud by aggregating multidomain topology information. Backed by the experimental results over the University of Bristol 5G test network, we demonstrate in practice that our framework outperforms the implementations of the lightweight M2M (LWM2M) and NETCONF Light IoT device management protocols when deployed autonomously at the network edge and/or the cloud. Specifically, SDIM edge deployments can lower the average device provisioning time as high as 46% compared to LWM2M and 60.3% compared to NETCONF Light. Moreover, it can decrease the average operational fault detection time by approximately 33% compared to LWM2M and roughly 40% compared to NETCONF Light. Also, SDIM reduces control operations time up to 27%, posing a powerful feature for use cases with time-critical control requirements. Last, SDIM manages to both reduce CPU consumption and to have important energy consumption gains at the network edge, which can reach as high as 20% during device provisioning and 4.5%-4.9% during fault detection compared to the benchmark framework deployments. © 2014 IEEE.}

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to improve the individuals' quality of life. However, ensuring security and privacy in the IoT context is a non-trivial task due to the low capability of these connected devices. Generally, the IoT device management is based on a centralized entity that validates communication and connection rights. Therefore, this centralized entity can be considered as a single point of failure. Yet, in the case of distributed approaches, it is difficult to delegate the right validation to IoT devices themselves in untrustworthy IoT environments. Fortunately, the blockchain may provide decentralization of overcoming the trust problem while designing a privacy-preserving system. To this end, we propose a novel privacy-preserving IoT device management framework based on the blockchain technology. In the proposed system, the IoT devices are controlled by several smart contracts that validate the connection rights according to the privacy permission settings predefined by the data owners and the stored record array of detected misbehavior of each IoT device. In fact, smart contracts can immediately detect the devices that have vulnerabilities and have been hacked or pose a threat to the IoT network. Therefore, the data owner's privacy is preserved by enforcing the control over the own devices. For validation purposes, we deploy the proposed solution on a private Ethereum blockchain and give the performance evaluation. © 2021 ACM.}

Due to various physical and software related failure causes, monitoring has always been a challenging task. A visual inspection by human operators is a reliable method which is widely used for checking device's status. However, growth of number of devices in data centers causes exponential cost growth for visual checks and it is almost impossible to detect anomaly occurrences in real time.

Plan Ceibal distributes laptops and tablets to students and teachers, and also deploys a nationwide wireless network to provide Internet access to these devices, provides video conference facilities, and develops educational applications. Given the scale of the program, management in general, and specifically device management, is a very challenging task. Device maintenance and replacement is a particularly important process; users trigger such kind of replacement processes and usually imply several days without the device. Early detection of fault conditions in the most stressed hardware parts (e.g., batteries) would permit to prompt defensive replacement, contributing to reduce downtime, and improving the user experience. Seeking for better, preventive and scalable device management, in this paper we present a prototype of a Mobile Device Management (MDM) module for Plan Ceibal, developed over an IoT infrastructure, showing the results of a controlled experiment over a sample of the devices. The prototype is deployed over a public IoT infrastructure to speed up the development process, avoiding, in this phase, the need for local infrastructure and maintenance, while enforcing scalability and security requirements.

Accordingly, IoT edge devices, with the increasing demand of computation workloads on them, are prone to failures more than ever. Hard failures in hardware due to aging and reliability degradation are particularly important since they are irrecoverable, requiring maintenance for the replacement of defective parts, at high costs. In this article, we propose a novel dynamic reliability management (DRM) technique for multigateway IoT edge computing systems to mitigate degradation and defer early hard failures. Taking advantage of the edge computing architecture, we utilize gateways for computation offloading with the primary goal of maximizing the battery lifetime of edge devices, while satisfying the Quality of Service (QoS) and reliability requirements. We present a two-level management scheme, which work together to 1) choose the offloading rates of edge devices; 2) assign edge devices to gateways; and 3) decide multihop data flow routes and rates in the network. The offloading rates are selected by a hierarchical multitimescale distributed controller. We assign edge devices by solving a bottleneck generalized assignment problem (BGAP) and compute optimal flows in a fully distributed fashion, leveraging the subgradient method. Our results, based on real measurements and trace-driven simulation, demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve a similar battery lifetime and better QoS compared to the state-of-the-art approaches while satisfying reliability requirements, where other approaches fail by a large margin.  © 2014 IEEE.}

	abstract = {Consuming fresh drupes, vegetables can help lower a chance of developing several chronic diseases. Unfortunately, the post-harvest life cycle's storage stage is where fruits and vegetables (FVs) lose the most of all the food that is produced annually. A failure to recognize important ambient environmental conditions when using cold storage seems to be the main causes of this elevated loss rate. The current monitoring systems for cold storage are only able to measure warmth and moistness and ignoring further crucial acceptable surrounding factors of radiance and gas quantity. Serious matter gets handled in order to lower the system's harm degree. The real time intelligent monitoring and notification system (RT-IMNS) for icy container is described briefly in the paper. It employs a device management platform (IoT)-enabled technique to continuously monitor hotness, comparative moisture, brightness, fume quantity and alert staff when dangerous thresholds are reached. © 2025 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

	journal = {Proceedings of the IEEE Power Engineering Society Transmission and Distribution Conference},
	abstract = {Emerging use-cases that involve vast amounts of high-resolution sensor data are prompting utilities to reconsider their conventional approaches to handling such data. In this paper, an open-platform solution is proposed for a big data analytics platform that leverages vendor-distributed software. The platform outlines a comprehensive solution to effectively handle large volumes of high-resolution sensor data, specifically targeting substation digital fault recorders. This open-platform approach is intended to be extensible to various other data streams and sensor types. To establish an end-to-end data pipeline from the edge to centralized databases, employed are a combination of tools and processes. This includes deploying an edge agent, MiNiFi, data ingestions using NiFi, and an extract-transform-load (ETL) process powered by Spark and Hive. Scalable device management is achieved through Cloudera Edge Management. Additionally, a database schema is introduced tailored to PoW data to ensure data integrity across multiple DFRs. Throughout the implementation of this approach, challenges included addressing high CPU usage stemming from the MiNiFi agent, configuring the Hadoop system, converting Spark code, and optimizing the ETL processing of continuous PoW files. By adopting an open-platform approach, adaptability of this platform provides insights into addressing key implementation challenges. © 2024 IEEE.}

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is a science that can actually be accomplished by a computer interfaced with devices such as robots to automate smart behaviors. The complexity of the intelligence networks is greatly enhanced for the growth of industrial production and power systems. As a result of this power system research, the process of information, remote device management, and utility have become more complicated and time-consuming, using traditional techniques and conclusions from the data acquired. In the current scenario approach, AI is needed in various field of power system such as planning for generation expansion, power system reliability, transmission line expansion, planning and operation of the distribution system, forecasting for electricity, control of reactive power, control of voltage, frequency and stability. With the increasing development of renewable system application, AI is also enhanced in the control of fuel cell and wind solar thermal hybrid power system. Further these advanced techniques are also utilized in automation for restoration, fault analysis, and network security. AI is designed and deployed with the aid of advanced technology tools to solve all of the aforementioned problems for large power systems as the mother of innovation is needed. Over the last few decades, a problem with traditional approaches has been identified by researchers, making AI techniques an effective tool to solve problems with the power system. Most power system problems are focused on a range of unfeasible demands. And the techniques of AI are the only ways to resolve them. Another requirement of AI in power system is reliable and efficient supply of energy, which is an important requirement for the world to avoid environmental impacts. It is achieved by tight supervision of the machinery and through the use of the power system. It needs highly effective, accurate, and automated AI-based techniques such as energy management system, intelligent substation ornamented with high-speed surveillance, monitoring, and communication. With the promotion of these advances through AI techniques, savings can be made in the field of remote monitoring of equipment, service, maintenance, and production. A great deal of research has been done, and a great deal of research is yet to be done to take full advantage of AI technology for cost reduction by improving the efficiency of the power system, centralized control, and monitoring. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.
