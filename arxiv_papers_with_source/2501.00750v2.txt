Summary: This study proposes the design and implementation of a multimodal LLM-based
Multi-Agent System (MAS) leveraging a No-Code platform to address the practical
constraints and significant entry barriers associated with AI adoption in
enterprises. Advanced AI technologies, such as Large Language Models (LLMs),
often pose challenges due to their technical complexity and high implementation
costs, making them difficult for many organizations to adopt. To overcome these
limitations, this research develops a No-Code-based Multi-Agent System designed
to enable users without programming knowledge to easily build and manage AI
systems. The study examines various use cases to validate the applicability of
AI in business processes, including code generation from image-based notes,
Advanced RAG-based question-answering systems, text-based image generation, and
video generation using images and prompts. These systems lower the barriers to
AI adoption, empowering not only professional developers but also general users
to harness AI for significantly improved productivity and efficiency. By
demonstrating the scalability and accessibility of No-Code platforms, this
study advances the democratization of AI technologies within enterprises and
validates the practical applicability of Multi-Agent Systems, ultimately
contributing to the widespread adoption of AI across various industries.
