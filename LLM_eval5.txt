Title: When Relevance Meets Novelty: Dual-Stable Periodic Optimization for Exploratory Recommendation
Abstract: Traditional recommendation systems tend to trap users in strong feedback
loops by excessively pushing content aligned with their historical preferences,
thereby limiting exploration opportunities and causing content fatigue.
Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate potential with their diverse
content generation capabilities, existing LLM-enhanced dual-model frameworks
face two major limitations: first, they overlook long-term preferences driven
by group identity, leading to biased interest modeling; second, they suffer
from static optimization flaws, as a one-time alignment process fails to
leverage incremental user data for closed-loop optimization. To address these
challenges, we propose the Co-Evolutionary Alignment (CoEA) method. For
interest modeling bias, we introduce Dual-Stable Interest Exploration (DSIE)
module, jointly modeling long-term group identity and short-term individual
interests through parallel processing of behavioral sequences. For static
optimization limitations, we design a Periodic Collaborative Optimization (PCO)
mechanism. This mechanism regularly conducts preference verification on
incremental data using the Relevance LLM, then guides the Novelty LLM to
perform fine-tuning based on the verification results, and subsequently feeds
back the output of the incrementally fine-tuned Novelty LLM to the Relevance
LLM for re-evaluation, thereby achieving a dynamic closed-loop optimization.
Extensive online and offline experiments verify the effectiveness of the CoEA
model in exploratory recommendation.

1. \subsection{Causal Self-Attention}
\label{subsec:causal_attn}
Causal self-attention \cite{yang2021causal} maintains temporal ordering constraints in sequence modeling across $L$L layers by ensuring that position \(i\)i cannot attend to any subsequent positions \(j > i\)j > i at each layer. For an input sequence \(\bm{H}^{(l-1)} \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times d}\)\bm{H}H^{(l-1)}(l-1) \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times d}T \times d at the \(l\)l-th layer (where \(1 \leq l \leq L\)1 \leq l \leq L), query (\(\bm{Q}\)\bm{Q}Q), key (\(\bm{K}\)\bm{K}K), and value (\(\bm{V}\)\bm{V}V) matrices are generated through three learnable projections \(\bm{W}_Q, \bm{W}_K, \bm{W}_V \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d_k}\)\bm{W}W_Q, \bm{W}W_K, \bm{W}W_V \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d_k}d \times d_k, with each matrix derived by multiplying the input sequence by its corresponding projection matrix.
Attention weights at each layer are computed under temporal constraints using these three matrices:
\begin{equation}
\bm{A} = \text{softmax}( \frac{\bm{Q}\bm{K}^T}{\sqrt{d_k}} + \bm{M} ) \bm{V},
\label{eq:15}
\end{equation}\begin{equation}
\bm{A} = \text{softmax}( \frac{\bm{Q}\bm{K}^T}{\sqrt{d_k}} + \bm{M} ) \bm{V},
\label{eq:15}
\end{equation}
\bm{A}A = \text{softmax}( \frac{\bm{Q}\bm{K}^T}{\sqrt{d_k}} + \bm{M}M ) \bm{V}V,
\label{eq:15}
Next:
1. The encoder \(\mathcal{E}\)\mathcal{E} compresses continuous vectors into a latent embedding \(\bm{z} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_z}\)\bm{z}z \in \mathbb{R}^{d_z}d_z through \(\bm{z} = \mathcal{E}(\bm{u};\theta_E)\)\bm{z}z = \mathcal{E}(\bm{u}u;\theta_E). Quantization then occurs through \(K\)K residual steps, where each step \(k\)k selects the closest codebook vector to the current residual as \(\bm{q}^{(k)} = \underset{\bm{c} \in \mathcal{C}^{(k)}}{\arg\min} \|\bm{r}^{(k)} - \bm{c}\|_2\)\bm{q}q^{(k)}(k) = \underset{\bm{c} \in \mathcal{C}^{(k)}}\bm{c}c \in \mathcal{C}^{(k)}(k){\arg\min}\arg\min \|\bm{r}r^{(k)}(k) - \bm{c}c\|_2,
\begin{equation}
\bm{r}^{(k+1)} = \bm{r}^{(k)} - \bm{q}^{(k)},
\end{equation}\begin{equation}
\bm{r}^{(k+1)} = \bm{r}^{(k)} - \bm{q}^{(k)},
\end{equation}
\bm{r}r^{(k+1)}(k+1) = \bm{r}r^{(k)}(k) - \bm{q}q^{(k)}(k),
2. where \(\bm{r}^{(0)} = \bm{z}\)\bm{r}r^{(0)}(0) = \bm{z}z initializes the residual.
The Group CSID combines quantization indices into \(CSID(\bm{u}) = (i^{(1)}, i^{(2)}, ..., i^{(K)})\)CSID(\bm{u}u) = (i^{(1)}(1), i^{(2)}(2), ..., i^{(K)}(K)), with \(i^{(k)}\)i^{(k)}(k) denoting the codebook index of \(\bm{q}^{(k)}\)\bm{q}q^{(k)}(k). Reconstruction uses decoder \(\mathcal{D}\)\mathcal{D} to map the quantized embedding $\bm{\hat{z}} = \sum_{i = 1}^{K} \bm{q}^{(i)}$\bm{\hat{z}}\hat{z} = \sum_{i = 1}i = 1^{K}K \bm{q}q^{(i)}(i) back to the input space as \(\hat{\bm{u}} = \mathcal{D}(\bm{\hat{z}};\theta_D)\)\hat{\bm{u}} = \mathcal{D}(\bm{\hat{z}}\hat{z};\theta_D).

generate_answer: To address the limitations of existing LLM-enhanced dual-model frameworks, we propose the Co-Evolutionary Alignment (CoEA) method. CoEA consists of two main components: the Dual-Stable Interest Exploration (DSIE) module and the Periodic Collaborative Optimization (PCO) mechanism. The DSIE module jointly models long-term group identity and short-term individual interests through parallel processing of behavioral sequences, thereby addressing the interest modeling bias. The PCO mechanism, on the other hand, conducts preference verification on incremental data using the Relevance LLM and guides the Novelty LLM to perform fine-tuning based on the verification results, thereby achieving a dynamic closed-loop optimization. Extensive online and offline experiments verify the effectiveness of the CoEA model in exploratory recommendation.

original_answer: where the scaled dot product of query and key matrices is computed by dividing their product by \(\sqrt{d_k}\)\sqrt{d_k}. A causal mask \(\bm{M}\)\bm{M}M — with \(\bm{M}_{ij} = 0\)\bm{M}M_{ij}ij = 0 if \(i \geq j\)i \geq j and \(\bm{M}_{ij} = -\infty\)\bm{M}M_{ij}ij = -\infty if \(i < j\)i < j — is added to enforce autoregressive properties. Softmax is applied to this result, which is then multiplied by the value matrix to generate attention output \(\bm{A}\)\bm{A}A.
This mask prevents future information leakage, ensuring temporal consistency across \(L\)L layers. Each layer’s output is \(\bm{H}^{(l)} = \text{LayerNorm}\left( \bm{A} + \bm{H}^{(l-1)} \right)\)\bm{H}H^{(l)}(l) = \text{LayerNorm}\left( \bm{A}A + \bm{H}H^{(l-1)}(l-1) \right). For the final token at position \(T\)T, its layer-\(l\)l representation is \(\bm{H}^{(l)}_T\)\bm{H}H^{(l)}(l)_T; after \(L\)L layers, \(\bm{H}^{(L)}_T\)\bm{H}H^{(L)}(L)_T encodes the entire sequence’s hierarchical context.
\subsection{RQ-VAE for Group Clustering}
\label{subsec:rq_vae}
Residual-Quantized Variational AutoEncoder (RQ-VAE) \cite{rajput2023recommender} provides hierarchical vector quantization for efficient representation learning. Given user representations \(\bm{u} \in \mathbb{R}^d\)\bm{u}u \in \mathbb{R}^d encoded from long-term sequences, we map them to discrete Group Collaborative Semantic IDs (Group CSID) that capture stable group preferences.
