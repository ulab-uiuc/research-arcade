You are given the following inputs:
Figure (optional): {figure_content_or_caption} with label {figure_label}
Table (optional): {table_content_or_caption} with label {table_label}
Abstract of cited paragraph: {abstract_text}
{k} Most Adjacent Paragraphs:
{adjacent_paragraphs_block}

Task
Generate the missing paragraph as a single LaTeX-formatted paragraph that naturally fits between the adjacent paragraphs.
Requirements
Integrate all provided materials:
If a figure is provided, refer to it explicitly (e.g., Figure~\\ref{{{figure_label}}}) and use at least one concrete detail from {figure_content_or_caption}.
If a table is provided, refer to it explicitly (e.g., Table~\\ref{{{table_label}}}) and use at least one concrete detail from {table_content_or_caption}.
Incorporate at least one core claim or finding from the abstract (cite it as \\citep{{CITED_PAPER}}; if a BibTeX key is known, replace CITED_PAPER accordingly).
Ensure the paragraph logically continues from and sets up the surrounding {k} adjacent paragraphs.
Style & Formatting
Output only one LaTeX paragraph (no section headers, lists, environments, or math unless essential).
Use Figure~\\ref{...} and/or Table~\\ref{...} for cross-references; do not add \\label{} in the paragraph.
Use \\citep{...} for the abstract citation.
Keep it objective, concise, and academic (approx. 120–180 words).
Content Constraints
Do not include placeholders like “Figure X” or “Table Y”—use the given labels.
Do not repeat raw table/figure content verbatim; summarize or interpret key points.
Do not add extra text outside the paragraph.
Output
Return only the LaTeX paragraph text.
