  "abstract": "World models (WMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in prediction, generation,\nand planning tasks. Existing WMs primarily focus on unstructured data and\ncannot leverage the ubiquitous structured data, often represented as graphs, in\nthe digital world. While multiple graph foundation models have been proposed,\nthey focus on graph learning tasks and cannot extend to diverse multi-modal\ndata and interdisciplinary tasks. To address these challenges, we propose the\nGraph World Model (GWM), a world model that supports both unstructured and\ngraph-structured states with multi-modal information and represents diverse\ntasks as actions. The core of a GWM is a generic message-passing algorithm to\naggregate structured information, either over a unified multi-modal token space\nby converting multi-modal data into text (GWM-T) or a unified multi-modal\nembedding space by modality-specific encoders (GWM-E). Notably, GWM introduces\naction nodes to support diverse tasks, where action nodes are linked to other\nnodes via direct reference or similarity computation. Extensive experiments on\nsix tasks from diverse domains, including multi-modal generation and matching,\nrecommendation, graph prediction, multi-agent, retrieval-augmented generation,\nand planning and optimization, show that the same GWM outperforms or matches\ndomain-specific baselines' performance, benefits from multi-hop structures, and\ndemonstrates strong zero-shot/few-shot capabilities on unseen new tasks. Our\ncode for GWM is released at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/GWM.",
