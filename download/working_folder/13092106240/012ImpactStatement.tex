\section*{Impact Statement}
\envname presents an LLM-based simulation framework that models human research communities as graph-based multi-agent systems, enabling the study of collaboration, knowledge diffusion, and institutional dynamics. By formalizing how agents create, refine, and evaluate academic papers, the simulator can inform the design of autonomous research systems that assist, rather than replace, human researchers. Potential applications include optimizing collaboration structures, identifying systemic bottlenecks in peer review or discovery, and stress-testing scientific workflows under various incentive and communication settings. While the framework is primarily a research tool, we acknowledge that future extensions involving autonomous agents could raise ethical considerations around authorship, influence, and epistemic trust. Our work highlights the imperative for adaptive ethical frameworks that keep pace with technological capabilities while protecting scholarly values.
