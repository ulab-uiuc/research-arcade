\begin{abstract}
Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in scientific domains, yet a fundamental question remains unanswered: \textit{Can we simulate human research communities with LLMs?} Addressing this question can deepen our understanding of the processes behind idea brainstorming and inspire the automatic discovery of novel scientific insights. In this work, we propose \envname, a multi-agent framework for research community simulation. Within this framework, the human research community is simplified as an \textit{agent-data graph}, where researchers and papers are represented as agent-type and data-type nodes, respectively, and connected based on their collaboration relationships. We also introduce \textit{TextGNN}, a text-based inference framework that models various research activities (\eg, paper reading, paper writing, and review writing) as special forms of a unified message-passing process on the agent-data graph. To evaluate the quality of the research community simulation, we present \benchname, a benchmark that uses a node-masking prediction task for scalable and objective assessment based on similarity. Our experiments reveal three key findings: (1) \envname can provide a realistic simulation of collaborative research activities, including paper writing and review writing; (2) \envname can maintain robust simulation with multiple researchers and diverse papers; (3) \envname can generate interdisciplinary research ideas that potentially inspire pioneering research directions.

% by Iain Murray in 2018, and modified by Alexandre Bouchard in
% 2019 and 2021 and by Csaba Szepesvari, Gang Niu and Sivan Sabato in 2022.
% Modified again in 2023 and 2024 by Sivan Sabato and Jonathan Scarlett.
% Previous contributors include Dan Roy, Lise Getoor and Tobias
% Scheffer, which was slightly modified from the 2010 version by
% Thorsten Joachims & Johannes Fuernkranz, slightly modified from the
% 2009 version by Kiri Wagstaff and Sam Roweis's 2008 version, which is
% slightly modified from Prasad Tadepalli's 2007 version which is a
% lightly changed version of the previous year's version by Andrew
% Moore, which was in turn edited from those of Kristian Kersting and
% Codrina Lauth. Alex Smola contributed to the algorithmic style files.
