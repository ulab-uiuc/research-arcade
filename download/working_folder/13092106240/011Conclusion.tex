\section{Conclusion}

We introduce \envname, a graph-based multi-agent framework that simulates research communities by modeling them as heterogeneous graphs. \envname integrates key research activities—paper reading, writing, and reviewing—into a unified TextGNN-driven inference process. It enables realistic and robust simulations through agent collaboration and facilitates rare interdisciplinary interactions. \envname offers a valuable platform for studying research dynamics and developing algorithms to support automated scientific discovery.
