methodologies for investigating the human mind and behaviors, while offering valuable insights into the design and understanding of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems.\nFocusing on psychology as a prominent case, this study explores the interdisciplinary synergy between AI and the field by analyzing 1,006 LLM-related papers published in premier AI venues between 2023 and 2025, along with the 2,544 psychology publications they cite.\nThrough our analysis, we identify key patterns of interdisciplinary integration, locate the psychology domains most frequently referenced, and highlight areas that remain underexplored. \nWe further examine how psychology theories/frameworks are operationalized and interpreted, identify common types of misapplication, and offer guidance for more effective incorporation.\nOur work provides a comprehensive map of interdisciplinary engagement between AI and psychology, thereby facilitating deeper collaboration and advancing AI systems.\n\n\\end{abstract}", "citations": {"floridi2023ethics": {"bib_key": "floridi2023ethics", "bib_title": "The ethics of artificial intelligence: Principles, challenges, and opportunities",

"\\label{sec:1}\n\nIn recent years, the rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled the development of more capable and innovative intelligent systems and has reshaped the way we study and conduct AI research.\nOne of the most notable trends is toward research pluralism.\nScholars increasingly recognize the importance of complementing traditional AI methodologies with broader approaches to further interpret, guide, and advance contemporary AI systems (e.g.,~\\citealp{floridi2023ethics, lin2025fostering}).\nAs a result, insights from the humanities and social sciences, particularly psychology, linguistics, cognitive science, and philosophy, are being integrated into AI research at an unprecedented scale and depth (e.g.,~\\citealp{crawford2021atlas, lake2017building, mccarthy2006proposal}).\n\n\n\nOne notable example of this interdisciplinary turn is the surge of interest in Large Language Models (LLMs; e.g.,~\\citealp{geminiteam2024gemini,meta2025llama4,gpt-4o,gpt-oseries}).\nAs AI systems progress from functioning primarily as interpreters to also becoming generative agents, LLMs have scaled up from smaller models that originally served as vehicles for language\u2014the principal medium of human communication.\nWith superior capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, these larger models have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of downstream tasks and are increasingly integrated into practical applications across diverse sectors, including education (e.g.,\\citealp{kasneci2023chatgpt}), healthcare (e.g.,\\citealp{singhal2023medicine}), law (e.g.,\\citealp{katz2024gpt}), scientific research (e.g.,\\citealp{meyer2023chatgpt}), and commerce (e.g.,\\citealp{li2024ecomgpt}).\nIn doing so, LLMs have been profoundly redefining the modalities of knowledge acquisition and dissemination (e.g.,~\\citealp{gao2024taxonomy}).\nHowever, despite their impressive capabilities, the internal mechanisms of LLMs remain largely opaque (e.g.,\\citealp{bommasani2022opportunities}), rendering many of their exhibited behaviors unintended rather than well-understood or explainable (e.g.,\\citealp{schaeffer2023emergent, wei2022emergent}).\nLLMs are consequently characterized as \\textit{`black-box'} systems within both academic and industrial contexts, creating the challenging situation where users expect or steer what occurs without understanding why it occurs (e.g.,~\\citealp{lipton2018mythos, rudin2019stop}).\nAdvancing LLM research urgently requires the development of systematic frameworks for evaluation, interpretability, and human-model interaction, which are essential for addressing foundational challenges related to reasoning mechanisms (e.g.,~\\citealp{zhao2024explainability}), capability boundaries (e.g.,~\\citealp{10.1145/3641289}), and alignment with human values and safety (e.g.,~\\citealp{ouyang2022rlhf}).\n\n\n\nThis is precisely where interdisciplinary research can play an important role in developing meaningful solutions.\nFor example, the aforementioned research challenge concerning LLMs parallels a fundamental issue that psychology has grappled with since its inception.\nThe discipline has progressed through the systematic observation and generalization of intelligent human behavior (e.g.,~\\citealp{skinner1965science, watson1913psychology, wundt1904principles}). \nIn the absence of direct access to the underlying mechanisms of the human mind, psychologists have historically relied on rigorous experimental designs and theoretical modeling to describe, explain, predict, and influence cognitive and behavioral processes (e.g.,~\\citealp{bunge2017philosophy, gigerenzer1991tools, shiffrin1997art}). \nDrawing on this legacy, psychology's empirical tradition and sophisticated experimental paradigms offer a structured, systematic blueprint for advancing LLM research.\n\n\n\nHowever, interdisciplinary collaboration is not without its challenges.\nWhen knowledge is transferred across disciplinary boundaries, researchers often encounter conceptual ambiguities and methodological tensions (e.g.,~\\citealp{salter1997outside, huutoniemi2010evaluating}).\nTerms may carry different meanings in different fields (e.g., differing interpretations of ``attention'' in LLM and psychology research), which can lead to misunderstandings, misinterpretations, and communication barriers in interdisciplinary research.\nSuperficial understandings of complex theories may lead to misapplication (e.g., superficial use of motivation theory from psychology to AI design, which ignores human-specific factors like developmental context and lived experience), potentially overlooking critical context-specific factors and resulting in flawed designs or conclusions.\nIn some cases, speculative or pseudo-scientific reasoning may inadvertently arise (e.g., equating the model\u2019s output diversity with human creativity), which can erode scientific credibility and mislead both academic and public audiences about the nature and capabilities of AI.\nMoreover, due to an insufficient or superficial understanding of theory, research may tends to repeatedly draw on a narrow set of well-known theories, favoring familiarity and accessibility over theoretical fit. \nThis overreliance can crowd out alternative perspectives, stifle theoretical innovation, and reinforce conceptual blind spots in the field.\nAll these challenges are deeply felt by AI researchers navigating interdisciplinary work, who often find themselves grappling with questions such as: Which areas of social science are relevant? What theories or frameworks from these areas should we use? How should they be cited appropriately? And how can these concepts be meaningfully and responsibly integrated into technical research?\n\nThis paper explores how AI researchers are drawing on psychology literature in their work on LLMs, using this as a way to reflect on how current AI research engages with and integrates interdisciplinary theories and methods.\nSpecifically, we address the following three core research questions and offer theoretical and methodological recommendations aimed at strengthening research pluralism in AI research, thereby guiding future exploration and facilitating better interdisciplinary research practices:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{RQ1}: How is psychology research integrated into LLM research?\n    \\item \\textbf{RQ2}: Which psychology theories/frameworks are most commonly used, and which remain underexplored in LLM research?\n    \\item \\textbf{RQ3}: How is psychology research operationalized and interpreted in the context of LLM research?\n\\end{itemize}\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{RQ1}: How is psychology research integrated into LLM research?\n    \\item \\textbf{RQ2}: Which psychology theories/frameworks are most commonly used, and which remain underexplored in LLM research?\n    \\item \\textbf{RQ3}: How is psychology research operationalized and interpreted in the context of LLM research?\n\\end{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{RQ1}: How is psychology research integrated into LLM research?\n    \\item \\textbf{RQ2}: Which psychology theories/frameworks are most commonly used, and which remain underexplored in LLM research?\n    \\item \\textbf{RQ3}: How is psychology research operationalized and interpreted in the context of LLM research?\n\n\n\n\nWe surveyed 25,843 LLM research articles and compiled a corpus of 1,006 papers that cited psychology research and were published in top-tier AI venues\\footnote{NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, ACL, TACL, EMNLP, and NAACL} between 2023 and 2025. \nFrom their references, we identified 2,544 psychology papers. \nBy analyzing thematic patterns, we mapped the application of psychology research in LLM research, highlighting key areas of interdisciplinary overlap, and revealing potential research gaps.\n\n\n\nBuilding on this foundation, our goal is to provide a rigorous, science-of-science analysis that maps the current intersection of AI and psychology, identifying emerging trends, critical gaps, and opportunities for impactful collaboration. \nBy systematically assessing the landscape, we not only help researchers navigate this rapidly evolving space but also highlight areas where psychological insights can meaningfully inform AI development. \nThis work is intended to foster responsible, well-informed interdisciplinary research, mitigate risks of conceptual misuse, and ultimately accelerate scientific progress in both fields.\nWe believe that just as psychology has significantly advanced our understanding of human intelligence, it also holds the potential to play an important role in uncovering and guiding the behavioral mechanisms of AI systems. \nThis study represents a key step toward that ambitious vision.\n\n", "appendix": false}, "Preliminaries": {"content": "\\label{sec:2}\n\n\\subsection{Generative artificial intelligence and large language models}\nGenerative AI is a subfield of AI that focuses on creating new content, such as text, images, audio, and video~\\citep{10.1145/3704262,Feuerriegel2024}, representing a shift from merely interpreting input to generating novel outputs in response to user input.\nAmong Generative AI systems, LLMs such as GPT~\\citep{gpt-4o,gpt-oseries}, Gemini~\\citep{geminiteam2024gemini}, and Llama~\\citep{meta2025llama4} stand out as prominent text-based technologies. \nSimilar progress is also observed in Multimodal Large Language Models~\\citep[MLLMs;][]{10.1093/nsr/nwae403}, exemplified by LLaVA~\\citep{10655294}, Claude 3~\\citep{TheC3}, and GPT-4V~\\citep{gpt-4v}, which further support visual content in both input and output.\nThey have sparked a wave of research spanning their entire life cycle, from architecture and pre-/post-training to application and evaluation, which inherently engages a wide range of human-centered disciplines.\n\n\n\nExisting LLMs are primarily decoder-only transformer models~\\citep{vaswani2017attention}, in which the attention mechanism (e.g.,~\\citealp{NIU202148,Soydaner2022}) is inspired by the concept of selective attention in cognitive science (e.g.,~\\citealp{BROADBENT195811,cherry1953some}).\nThis architecture has greatly benefited from scaling (e.g.,~\\citealp{NEURIPS2022_8c22e5e9,kaplan2020scaling}), as first demonstrated by GPT-3~\\citep{brown2020language}.\nThe massive scale places significantly greater demands on computational resources and learning design, which typically occurs in two stages: pre-training, which involves learning from large-scale text corpora and aligns with the goals of corpus linguistics~\\citep{hunston2006corpus}; and post-training, which varies depending on specific objectives. Representative post-training methods include: 1) instruction tuning (e.g.,~\\citealp{wei2022finetuned,zhang2024instructiontuning}), which enhances LLMs' generalization to unseen tasks;\n2) alignment tuning (e.g.,~\\citealp{wang2023aligning,wang2024comprehensive}), like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback~\\citep[RLHF;][]{ouyang2022rlhf} and Direct Preference Optimization~\\citep[DPO;][]{rafailov2023dpo}, which aligns LLMs with human intent and preferences;\nand 3) Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), such as prefix tuning~\\citep{li-liang-2021-prefix}, prompt tuning~\\citep{lester-etal-2021-power}, and Low-Rank Adaptation~\\citep[LoRA;][]{hu2022lora}, which enables effective adaptation of LLMs with a small subset of parameters being updated. \nPEFT is analogous to synaptic plasticity in neuroscience~\\citep{Citri2008}, where only specific neural pathways are strengthened or weakened in response to new information.\n\n\n\nSince their inception, and beyond language modeling and In-Context Learning~\\citep[ICL;][]{dong-etal-2024-survey}, LLMs have demonstrated remarkable advancements in their core capabilities, including long-context modeling (e.g.,~\\citealp{liu-etal-2024-lost,yen-etal-2024-long}), advanced reasoning (e.g.,~\\citealp{huang-chang-2023-towards,liu2025llmscapablestablereasoning,wei2023cot}), tool use (e.g.,~\\citealp{qin2024toolllm}), agency (e.g.,~\\citealp{ijcai2024p890,xi2023rise}), and retrieval (e.g.,~\\citealp{gao2024retrieval,wang2023augmenting}). \nThese emergent capabilities are accelerating their widespread adoption, leading to the development of domain-specific LLMs in fields such as law (e.g.,~\\citealp{lai2023largelanguagemodelslaw}), economics (e.g.,~\\citealp{horton2023largelanguagemodelssimulated}), medicine (e.g.,~\\citealp{singhal2023medicine}), education (e.g.,~\\citealp{BERNABEI2023100172}), and the arts (e.g.,~\\citealp{wang2024exploringpotentiallargelanguage}). \nHuman-AI collaboration is simultaneously strengthening across the broad intersections between LLMs and diverse domains, resulting in many specialized AI assistants that are already in practical use (e.g.,~\\citealp{copilot}).\nDespite notable progress, concerns about the social risks posed by LLMs continue to be raised (e.g.,~\\citealp{bommasani2022opportunities,street2024llm,wang2023decodingtrust,weidinger2021ethical}), making evaluation and alignment crucial steps toward ensuring their responsible use and continuous improvement~\\citep{10.1145/3641289,laskar-etal-2024-systematic}. \nNumerous well-crafted benchmarks (e.g.,~\\citealp{hendryckstest2021,srivastava2023beyond,10.5555/3666122.3668142,zhong-etal-2024-agieval}) and dynamic approaches (e.g.,~\\citealp{jiang2025raising,zhu2024dyval}) have been developed to evaluate LLMs from both holistic and targeted perspectives.\nMeanwhile, the objective of alignment is evolving from general human preference (e.g.,~\\citealp{ji2023beavertails}) toward personalized preferences (e.g.,~\\citealp{salemi-etal-2024-lamp,tan-etal-2024-personalized}), steerability (e.g.,~\\citealp{li-etal-2024-steerability,wang-etal-2024-helpsteer}), and social pluralism (e.g.,~\\citealp{10.1145/3706598.3713675,feng-etal-2024-modular}), reflecting a deepening exploration of LLMs' social impacts. \n\n\n\nNowadays, these models have long moved beyond being automatons confined to proof-of-concept experiments and are increasingly permeating human society, shaping both everyday life and various industries.\nAs LLMs approach superhuman performance in certain professional tasks, there is growing interest in their subhuman or possibly non-human-like side. \\textit{Do} similar behavioral patterns or principles exist in LLMs~\\citep{Gui_2023}? \\textit{What} are their internal mechanisms like~\\citep{han2025computationmechanismllmposition}? \\textit{How} can we learn from human cognition to overcome current limitations in efficiency (e.g.,~\\citealp{alizadeh-etal-2024-llm,10589417}), safety (e.g.,~\\citealp{10.5555/3692070.3694246,yi-etal-2024-vulnerability}), and social adaptiveness (e.g.,~\\citealp{10.1162/opmi_a_00160,LI2025108687})? The intensifying interconnection with human and emergent questions is pushing AI beyond computer science into the broader realm of social sciences. \n\n\n\n\\subsection{Psychology}\nPsychology is an empirical science that systematically studies mental phenomena and behavioral mechanisms. \nIt aims to uncover the underlying principles of how individuals perceive, think, feel, and behave in specific contexts (e.g.,~\\citealp{colman2016psychology, dewey1892psychology, james1892psychology, schacter2009psychology}). \nSince emerging from philosophy and physiology in the late 19th century, psychology has evolved from an early introspection-based approach to a methodology grounded in empirical research (e.g.,~\\citealp{benjamin2023brief, goodwin2015history, schultz2013history}). \nToday, it encompasses a range of subfields, including cognitive, social, developmental, and clinical psychology (see~\\citealp{apa_divisions}).\n\n\n\nAs an interdisciplinary and methodologically diverse science, psychology investigates internal cognitive processes such as attention (e.g.,~\\citealp{norman1986attention}), memory (e.g.,~\\citealp{atkinson1968human, baddeley2020working}), language (e.g.,~\\citealp{chomsky2002syntactic, pinker2003language}), and reasoning (e.g.,~\\citealp{doi:10.1126/science.185.4157.1124}), while also exploring how these processes are influenced by emotions (e.g.,~\\citealp{damasio2006descartes, ledoux1998emotional}), motivation (e.g.,~\\citealp{deci2013intrinsic}, developmental stages (e.g.,~\\citealp{piaget1952origins}), and sociocultural environments (e.g.,~\\citealp{henrich2010weirdest}).\nResearchers employ various methods, such as experimental design (e.g.,~\\citealp{reichardt2002experimental}), behavioral observation (e.g.,~\\citealp{bakeman2011sequential}), surveys (e.g.,~\\citealp{fowler2013survey}), neuroimaging techniques like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI; e.g.,~\\citealp{glover2011overview}), and computational modeling (e.g.,~\\citealp{guest2021computational}) to study psychological phenomena from multiple dimensions. \nThese approaches emphasize the operational definition of variables and statistical inference in order to reveal systematic patterns underlying behavior and mental activity (e.g.,~\\citealp{cohen1994earth, kerlinger1966foundations}).\n\n\n\nThe core objectives of psychology can be delineated into four dimensions (e.g.,~\\citealp{coon2013introduction}): description (the systematic observation and documentation of behavior and mental processes), explanation (the elucidation of underlying causes and mechanisms), prediction (the forecasting of future behavior based on theoretical frameworks), and intervention/influence (the ethically grounded facilitation of changes in psychological functioning and behavior).\nThese objectives exhibit a noteworthy alignment with contemporary inquiries into LLMs. \nWhile LLMs are constructed through well-defined algorithmic architectures and trained on extensive datasets, many of their sophisticated capabilities (e.g., logical reasoning, code generation) have emerged not as explicit design features, but rather as emergent phenomena associated with increased model scale (e.g.,~\\citealp{schaeffer2023emergent, wei2022emergent}). \nSuch phenomena underscore the current epistemic gap in our comprehension of LLMs' internal mechanisms: although we are accumulating observations of what these models can do, we still lack a systematic evaluation of their capabilities (e.g.,~\\citealp{belinkov2019analysis, bommasani2022opportunities}) and a clear understanding of the underlying reasons for their behaviors (e.g.,~\\citealp{10.1145/3641289, zhao2024explainability}).\n\n\n\nThis epistemological asymmetry naturally invites interdisciplinary engagement. \nIn particular, the theoretical paradigms and empirical methodologies developed within psychology may provide a productive lens through which to interrogate and interpret the behavior of LLMs (e.g.,~\\citealp{kosinski2023theory, lake2017building}). \nPsychology has historically played an important role in the development of AI, most notably during the early exploration of neural network theory, as exemplified by the perceptron model~\\citep{rosenblatt1958perceptron}. \nMore recently, psychological insights have continued to inform AI development; for example, attention mechanisms in advanced models (e.g.,~\\citealp{vaswani2017attention}) are conceptually inspired by research on human selective attention (e.g.,~\\citealp{BROADBENT195811, desimone1995neural, treisman1964selective}).\nFurthermore, recent studies have also demonstrated that insights from psychology research can significantly inform and enhance advancements in AI research (e.g., \\citealp{liu2025mind,dong2025humanizing,zhang-etal-2024-exploring}).\n\n\n\nHowever, despite this growing body of interdisciplinary work, the broader potential of psychological science to contribute to contemporary AI remains substantial and, in many respects, underexplored.\nIt is this largely untapped potential that motivates the present study. \nOur goal is to map the intersection between AI and psychology, identify trends, gaps, and opportunities for collaboration, and ultimately advance both fields. \nWe hope to help researchers gain a clearer understanding of this domain and promote responsible interdisciplinary collaboration.\n\n\n", "appendix": false}, "Analysis methodology": {"content": "\\label{sec:3}\n\n\\subsection{Data

Association for Computational Linguistics} (TACL)\n\nWe collected papers presented at the 2023 and 2024 editions of these venues (except for NAACL, a biennial conference, from which we included only the 2024 edition) and added nine papers from Volume 13 of TACL in 2025 (N = 25,843).\nTo ensure relevance to core LLM research areas, we only included papers that contained the terms \\textit{LLM} or \\textit{language model} in their title or abstract (N = 3,962). \n\nSubsequently, we extracted citation data for the remaining papers using the Semantic Scholar Academic Graph (S2AG) API\\footnote{https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api}, which indexes over 214 million scholarly works across diverse scientific domains. \nFrom this citation dataset, we identified and retained only those referenced papers classified under the field of \\textit{Psychology} but not under \\textit{Computer Science}, according to Semantic Scholar\u2019s disciplinary tagging.\nLLM-related papers that did not cite at least one such psychology reference were excluded from the final sample (N = 1,006).\n\nFollowing this multi-step curation process, our final dataset comprised 1,006 LLM research papers and 2,544 cited psychology reference papers.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Embedding and clustering}\\label{sec:3.2}\nWe employed the K-means clustering algorithm~\\citep{k-means,1056489,macqueen1967some} to discern thematic groupings within corpora of LLM research papers and psychology reference papers, respectively.\nSpecifically, we used the SPECTER model~\\citep{cohan-etal-2020-specter} to generate embeddings for each paper. \nSPECTER is a transformer model trained on citation networks to produce document-level embeddings; it takes the title and abstract of a paper as input.\nClustering was then performed across a range of cluster counts \\( K \\in [4, 10] \\) K \\in [4, 10] , with the silhouette coefficient computed for each configuration to assess clustering quality. \nThis procedure was repeated 50 times, and the value of \\( K \\) K  that yielded the highest average silhouette coefficient was selected as optimal.\n\nThis process yielded eight clusters for the LLM research papers and six for the psychology papers. \nThe topic of each cluster was then inferred through a two-stage process: first, by summarizing the paper titles and abstracts within each cluster into five salient phrases using GPT-4o across ten runs, and second, by manually synthesizing these outputs into a concise, representative cluster label. The instruction template for summarization is provided in App.~\\ref{app:instruction}, and the complete cluster names and descriptions can be found in \u00a7\\ref{sec:4}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Psychology theory/framework extraction and connection}\\label{sec:3.3}\nTo identify popular psychology theories and frameworks studied in the 2,544 psychology reference papers, we conducted the following three-step process:\nFirst, following the practice described in \u00a7\\ref{sec:3.2}, we clustered the psychology papers within each of the six aforementioned clusters, resulting in 32 secondary clusters.\nNext, in each secondary cluster, we 1) randomly sampled 20 papers and summarized their titles and abstracts into five key phrases using GPT-4o, which was repeated ten times; \nand 2) hired domain experts to derive a cluster label, i.e., a research topic, and identify two to four primary psychology theories or frameworks based on the summaries from GPT-4o.\nAdditionally, the experts were invited to suggest three more psychology theories or frameworks that are well-known in psychology but under-explored in LLM research for each primary cluster.\nFinally, we got a total of 96 popular psychology theories and frameworks, which were then linked to both psychology and LLM research papers. \n\n\n\nTo connect the identified theories and frameworks with the psychology papers in each primary cluster, we provided GPT-4.1 with the title and abstract of a paper, along with the list of popular theories/frameworks from a secondary cluster in each query. GPT-4.1 was then asked to determine whether the paper involves any of the listed theories or frameworks. The instruction template for the relevance judgment is provided in App.~\\ref{app:instruction}.\nOnce the relevant psychology papers were identified, we considered an LLM research paper to be associated with a given theory or framework if it cited any of the corresponding psychology papers.\nIn this way, we calculated the citation count for each identified psychology theory or framework across the surveyed papers. For each primary cluster, the three most frequently cited psychology theories/frameworks and the three underexplored ones were selected for analysis in \u00a7\\ref{sec:5.2}.

citation analysis was finished, we were able to clearly observe the interrelationships between the eight LLM research clusters and the six psychology research clusters. \nThe overall analysis results are presented in Fig.~\\ref{fig:bipart}. Fig.~\\ref{fig:citation_all} illustrates the temporal citation trends, while Fig.~\\ref{fig:citation_split} provides a more detailed view of how each LLM research cluster has cited papers from the psychology clusters across different time periods.\nWe observe the following patterns through our analysis.\n\n\n\n\\vspace{5pt}\n\\textbf{Finding 1: LLM research has increasingly cited psychology research in recent years.}\n\n\n\nWe first observed a growing trend in the incorporation of psychology research within the LLM literature over time.\nAs shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:citation_all}, the LLM research community has increasingly emphasized insights from psychology.\nThis trend began around March 2023, when researchers started citing certain clusters of psychology research \u2014 notably the \\textit{Neural Mechanism}, \\textit{Language}, and \\textit{Psychometrics \\& JDM} clusters, which were among the earliest to receive attention.\nSubsequently, around July 2023, the volume of psychology-related citations in LLM research saw a marked increase.\nLater, by mid to late 2024, the overall growth in citation volume began to slow down.\n\n\n\nWe speculate that this emerging trend can be understood in several ways.\nFirst, the initial references to psychology in LLM research around March 2023 appear to coincide with the release of GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4.\nThis event may have sparked heightened academic interest in the inner workings of LLMs.\nAt this early stage, researchers began drawing upon clusters most closely related to LLM mechanisms (\\textit{Neural Mechanism} and \\textit{Language}), as well as the cluster most relevant to model evaluation (\\textit{Psychometrics \\& JDM}).\nAround July 2023, the noticeable uptick in psychology-related citations may be linked to the release of open-source models like Llama2.\nThe accessibility and flexibility of open-source models likely facilitated interdisciplinary collaboration, allowing researchers to more freely modify model architectures and behaviors to explore psychologically informed hypotheses and experiments.\nBy the latter half of 2024, although citations of psychology in LLM research continued to rise, the rate of increase appeared to slow. \nThis stabilization may suggest that core psychology research has largely been assimilated into the LLM research framework.\n\n\n\n\\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.49\\linewidth}\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figures/citation_all.pdf}\n    \\caption{Overall Citation Flow from LLM Research Papers to Psychology Papers Over Time.}\n    \\label{fig:citation_all}\n\\end{wrapfigure}{l}l{0.49\\linewidth}0.49\\linewidth\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figures/citation_all.pdf}\n    \\caption{Overall Citation Flow from LLM Research Papers to Psychology Papers Over Time.}\n    \\label{fig:citation_all}\n\n\n\n\n\\vspace{5pt}\n\\textbf{Finding 2: Psychology is broadly integrated into LLM research, with particular emphasis on certain clusters (i.e., \\textit{Psychometrics \\& JDM} and \\textit{Neural Mechanisms}).}\n\nWe also found that psychology research is extensively referenced in LLM studies, with nearly all eight LLM research clusters drawing from multiple psychology clusters rather than a single domain (except for \\textit{Model Adaptation \\& Efficiency} $\\leftarrow$\\leftarrow \\textit{Social-Clinical}; see Fig.~\\ref{fig:bipart}).\nThis suggests that LLM research engages with various areas of psychology, depending on the specific research questions or methodological needs.\n\n\n\nMoreover, certain psychology research clusters are cited more frequently.\nAs shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:citation_all}, the distribution of citation frequency reveals a distinct hierarchical pattern: \\textit{Psychometrics \\& JDM} $\\approx$\\approx \\textit{Neural Mechanism} $>$> \\textit{Language} $>$> \\textit{Social Cognition} $\\gg$\\gg \\textit{Education} $\\approx$\\approx \\textit{Social-Clinical}. \nThis likely reflects differences in methodological or conceptual alignment, with some research clusters being more closely aligned with the core objectives of current LLM research than others.\n\n\n\nFor example, the \\textit{Psychometrics \\& JDM} cluster contributes important tools for modeling and evaluating cognitive-like behaviors in LLMs. \nFoundations such as Classical Test Theory~\\citep[CTT;][]{NOVICK19661} and Item Response Theory~\\citep[IRT;][]{lord1980applications} inform assessment frameworks, while work in judgment and decision-making (JDM) offers analogies for understanding LLM reasoning and uncertainty(e.g.,~\\citealp{ALABED2022121786, Placani2024}). \nSimilarly, the prominence of the \\textit{Neural Mechanism} cluster underscores the foundational role of neuroscience and cognitive psychology in shaping LLM research. \nSeminal contributions from these fields, such as Hebbian learning \\citep{hebb1949organization} and early connectionist models like the perceptron \\citep{rosenblatt1958perceptron}, have directly influenced the design of neural architectures, including modern deep learning models like transformers \\citep{NEURIPS2022_8c22e5e9,kaplan2020scaling}.\n\n\n\nIn contrast, \\textit{Education} and \\textit{Social-Clinical} clusters are cited less frequently, which we speculate may be due to several reasons.\nFirst, research in these clusters often relies on long-term, large-scale human feedback collection, which can slow the pace of LLM-related advancements. \nSecond, studies in these clusters often involve sensitive data, such as student or patient information, which raises significant privacy concerns and makes data sharing and reuse more difficult due to strict ethical and legal constraints.\nThird, many contributions from these clusters are commonly submitted to the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community ~\\citep{BLANDFORD201941,10.1145/3658619.3658621,10.1145/3290605.3300475}, which is not included in this survey due to methodological differences.\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figures/citation_split.pdf}\n    \\caption{Citation Flow from LLM Research Papers to Psychology Papers Over Time. \\\\\n\\textit{Note:} Each subfigure presents a grouping of research papers on LLMs organized by cluster, with colors indicating the corresponding clusters in the psychology literature.

clusters of LLM research exhibit different tendencies in referencing psychology research.}\n\n\n\nAfter examining the overall patterns of how LLM research has cited psychology literature, we further explored the specific clusters within LLM research (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:citation_split}).\nOverall, different clusters of LLM research tend to favor different clusters of psychology research, reflecting variations in research focus.\n\n\n\nFor example, \\textit{Educational Application} shows a clear citation preference for \\textit{Education}, while \\textit{Advanced Reasoning} tends to favor citations from \\textit{Neural Mechanisms}. \nThis pattern may be explained by the strong conceptual alignment between the LLM research cluster and the Psychology research cluster. \nSpecifically, educational applications naturally draw on foundational work in educational psychology; whereas reasoning tasks tend to rely on insights from cognitive neuroscience to model complex inferential behavior, which can be traced back to neurons in Artificial Neural Networks~\\citep[ANN;][]{485891}.\n\n\n\nOther clusters, such as \\textit{Model Adaptation \\& Efficiency} and \\textit{Social Intelligence} draw upon a substantially broader range of psychology clusters. \nThis likely reflects the greater conceptual complexity inherent in constructs such as adaptation and awareness, which place higher demands on researchers to cite multiple aspects of psychology research.\nFor example, \\textit{Social Intelligence} requires modeling human mental states and traits such as emotions~\\citep{ekman1992argument}, cultural beliefs~\\citep{doi:10.1073/pnas.0903616106}, mental health~\\citep{elliott2018empathy}, and personality~\\citep{john1999bigfive}.\nThis drives frequent citation of work from the \\textit{Social Cognition} and \\textit{Social-Clinical} psychology research clusters.\nAt the same time, evaluating social awareness often involves extensive human-subject studies, which frequently result in citations of inter-rater reliability measures~\\citep{cohen1960coefficient, fleiss1971measuring, 10.1093/ije/dyq191} from the \\textit{Psychometrics \\& JDM} cluster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Which psychology theories/frameworks are most commonly used, and which remain underexplored in LLM research?}\\label{sec:5.2}\n\nBuilding upon the analysis presented in \u00a7\\ref{sec:5.1}, which examined the overall citation patterns of psychology research within the LLM literature, we now undertake a more granular investigation into how LLM research engages with specific psychology theories and frameworks within each identified psychology research cluster. \nFor each cluster, we highlight both the most frequently cited theories/frameworks and those that remain underutilized or overlooked.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the cluster-specific analysis, we have identified the most influential psychology theories and frameworks across the entire LLM research landscape.\nBy examining the top 10 most frequently cited psychology papers across all clusters (see Table~\\ref{tab:top_10}), we find that the majority belong to the \\textit{Psychometrics \\& JDM} and \\textit{Neural Mechanisms} clusters, further supporting Finding 2 discussed in \u00a7\\ref{sec:5.1}. \nThe key theories represented in these influential works are Classical Test Theory (CTT) and Theory of Mind (ToM).\n\n\n\n\\begin{table}\n    \\small\n    \\centering\n    \\begin{tabular}{lll}\n    \\toprule\n    \\textbf{Topic} & \\textbf{Paper} &

is a psychotherapeutic framework that focuses on the interconnectedness of thoughts, emotions, and behaviors, aiming to help individuals identify and modify negative or maladaptive patterns.\nIt has been demonstrated to be effective for a range of problems, including alcohol and drug use problems, marital problems, and severe mental illness.\nIn this survey, CBT is the most frequently referenced theory/framework in the \\textit{Social-Clinical} cluster.\nLLM researchers primarily draw on paradigms from the CBT framework to develop models related to psychotherapy, resulting in 51 citations from the surveyed LLM research papers.\nFor example, \\citet{wang-etal-2024-patient} used the CBT framework and LLMs to simulate virtual patients with various cognitive distortions, which could serve as a training tool for therapists to help them learn how to effectively formulate real cognitive models.\nSimilarly, \\citet{xiao-etal-2024-healme} also adopted the CBT framework and proposed an LLM-based mental enhancement model (empathetic dialogue system) for cognitive framing therapy.\nLLM research has also explored integrating LLMs into various stages of the CBT process.\nFor example, \\citet{lissak-etal-2024-colorful} examined how LLMs could offer emotional support to queer adolescents, and \\citet{gabriel-etal-2024-ai} evaluated the feasibility and ethical considerations of applying LLMs in mental health support.\n\n\n\n\\textbf{Goffman\u2019s Theory of Stigma (GTS)} is a theory that explores how individuals with attributes deemed undesirable by society experience social disapproval, exclusion, and discrimination. \nIt emphasizes the role of societal norms and interactions in labeling individuals as deviant, leading to a spoiled social identity and altered self-concept.\nGTS has been influential in understanding the social dynamics of mental illness, physical disability, addiction, and other marginalized statuses, highlighting how stigma can affect access to resources, treatment engagement, and psychological well-being.\nLLM researchers have primarily drawn on GTS to explore whether LLMs exhibit bias and discrimination, and whether they amplify existing stigmas, resulting in 34 citations from the surveyed LLM research papers.\nFor example, \\citet{an-etal-2024-large} draws on the GTS that conceptualizes names as identity cues that function as social labels. \nBy using gendered and ethnically marked names, they examine whether LLMs implicitly activate stereotypical associations tied to specific social groups.\nSimilarly, \\citet{morabito-etal-2024-stop} adopts the GTS point of stigma not as a discrete or isolated event, but as a structural and dynamic process.\nOn this basis, this paper designs a dataset consisting of progressively intensified offensive language to model the escalation of stigmatization.\n\n\n\n\\textbf{Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)} is a standardized classification framework developed by the American Psychiatric Association for diagnosing mental health conditions.\nIt provides clinicians with a common language and specific diagnostic criteria based on observable symptoms and clinical features.\nThe DSM is widely used in research, clinical practice, and insurance reporting, and plays a central role in shaping the understanding, treatment, and categorization of mental disorders across diverse populations and settings.\nLLM researchers have primarily drawn on the DSM framework to guide the application of LLMs in the mental health domain, resulting in 33 citations from the surveyed LLM research papers.\nThe DSM provides clinical guidance, standardized symptom definitions, diagnostic labels, and decision-making criteria, thereby enhancing the scientific rigor, accuracy, and interpretability of LLM-based approaches.\nFor example, \\citet{rosenman-etal-2024-llm} leverages the DSM framework to enable LLMs to interpret unstructured psychological interviews for more accurate automated mental health assessments.\nSimilarly, \\citet{kang-etal-2024-cure}, building on the DSM framework, integrates contextual information about symptoms to design a novel approach for LLM-based psychiatric disorder detection, aiming to reduce potential errors in automated symptom recognition.\n\n\n\n\\paragraph{Under-explored theories/frameworks}Under-explored theories/frameworks\nIn addition to the three theories/frameworks widely adopted by most LLM researchers, we also list three others that are closely related to \\textit{Social-Clinical} cluster but have received relatively little attention in current LLM studies.\nThese theories have been extensively applied and have had a significant impact in the field of psychology. \nThey also hold the potential to offer new perspectives and valuable insights for LLM research, making them well worth further exploration and consideration.\n\n\n\n\\textbf{Biopsychosocial Model (BM)} is a holistic framework that conceptualizes health and illness as the result of an interaction between biological, psychological, and social factors. \nIt recognizes that mental and physical health are influenced not only by genetic or physiological processes, but also by emotions, thoughts, behaviors, relationships, and environmental contexts.\nBM is widely used in clinical assessment and treatment planning, especially in fields such as psychiatry, chronic pain management, and behavioral medicine, promoting a more integrated and person-centered approach to care.\nIn LLM research, the BM can serve as a guiding framework for modeling user behavior and tailoring responses in a human-centered manner.\nBy considering users\u2019 emotional states, cognitive patterns, and social contexts, LLMs can generate responses that are more empathetic, contextually relevant, and effective in addressing users\u2019 complex needs.\nThis approach enhances user trust, satisfaction, and long-term engagement by aligning model behavior with the multifaceted nature of human experience.\n\n\n\n\\textbf{Critical Race Theory (CRT)} is a framework that examines how race and racism are embedded within social structures, institutions, and policies. \nIt challenges the notion of racial neutrality and emphasizes that systemic inequality is maintained through laws, cultural narratives, and power dynamics that privilege dominant groups.\nCRT has been applied across disciplines such as education, public health, and sociology to highlight the lived experiences of marginalized communities and to advocate for structural change, equity, and social justice.\nIn LLM research, CRT can serve as a lens to critically assess and mitigate biases in model outputs, training data, and deployment contexts.\nBy incorporating CRT principles, researchers can better identify how LLMs might perpetuate racial stereotypes or inequities, and develop strategies to promote fairness, inclusivity, and accountability.\nThis includes refining datasets, adopting more equitable evaluation metrics, and designing interaction protocols that center the voices and perspectives of historically marginalized users.\n\n\n\n\\textbf{Health Belief Model (HBM)} is a framework that explains health-related behaviors by focusing on individuals\u2019 perceptions of risk and benefits. \nIt posits that behavior change is influenced by key factors such as perceived susceptibility to a health issue, perceived severity of the condition, perceived benefits of taking action, and perceived barriers to action.\nHBM has been widely applied in public health to design interventions that promote preventive health behaviors, such as vaccination, screening, and lifestyle modification, by addressing motivational and cognitive determinants of decision-making.\nIn LLM research, the HBM can also serve as a theoretical framework for understanding and guiding user behavior. \nResearchers can leverage key components of the HBM, such as perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, and perceived barriers, to design more persuasive and personalized dialogue strategies, thereby enhancing interaction quality and the model\u2019s ability to influence user behavior. \nBy identifying users\u2019 motivations and concerns when responding to model-generated suggestions, LLMs can dynamically adjust their outputs to improve the adoption rate and trustworthiness of their recommendations. \n\n\n\n\\begin{table}\n

\\label{fig:theory_1}\n\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Learning, teaching design, and educational development}\\label{sec:5.2.2}\n\n\\paragraph{Popular theories/frameworks}Popular theories/frameworks\nIn the \\textit{Education} cluster, the three most frequently referenced psychology theories/frameworks in the surveyed LLM research papers are \\textit{Self-Regulated Learning} (SRL; e.g.,~\\citealp{graham1993srl}), \\textit{Instructional Scaffolding} (IS; e.g.,~\\citealp{penny1991moving}), and \\textit{Bloom's Taxonomy} (BT; e.g.,~\\citealp{bloom1956taxonomy}).\nTheir citation distributions across the eight LLM research topics are shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:theory_1}.\n\n\n\n\\textbf{Self-Regulated Learning (SRL)} is a theory that highlights the active role learners play in their own educational processes by setting goals, monitoring progress, and reflecting on outcomes. \nIt emphasizes the cyclical interaction between cognitive, metacognitive, motivational, and behavioral components, enabling learners to strategically manage their learning environments and efforts. \nSRL has been shown to enhance academic performance, foster lifelong learning skills, and support students across diverse contexts, including online learning, special education, and higher education settings.\nIn this survey, SRL is the most frequently referenced theory/framework in the \\textit{Education} cluster.\nLLM researchers have drawn on the SRL to inspire the design of self-improving LLM systems, resulting in 70 citations from the surveyed LLM research papers.\nThe principles of SRL, especially self-monitoring and iterative feedback, have guided work in enabling LLMs to autonomously refine their outputs across domains, including problem solving \\citep{gou2024critic,wang-etal-2024-bridging}, fact-checking \\citep{ying-etal-2024-llms,yu2024kola}, code generation \\citep{huang2024effilearner}, and data synthesis \\citep{shi-etal-2024-culturebank}, thereby leveraging their reasoning capacity and internal knowledge structures.\nLLM also adopted the SRL theory to support education applications.\nFor example, \\citet{macina-etal-2023-mathdial} involved LLMs in the construction of dialog-based tutoring datasets to support reflective math learning, and \\citet{borges-etal-2024-teach} explored how LLM-generated feedback can model and enhance SRL strategies in educational contexts.\n\n\n\n\\textbf{Instructional Scaffolding (IS)} is an educational framework that emphasizes the gradual support of learners as they develop new skills and understanding, with the ultimate goal of fostering independent competence. \nIt involves the strategic use of guidance, prompts, and resources by instructors to bridge the gap between what learners can do alone and what they can achieve with assistance. \nIS has been shown to be effective in various learning contexts, including literacy development, problem-solving, and complex conceptual learning across age groups and subject areas.\nIn LLM research, IS has inspired the design of prompting strategies that position LLMs as instructional agents capable of guiding users through incremental reasoning. It received 55 citations from the surveyed LLM research papers.\nFor example, \\citet{daheim-etal-2024-stepwise}, \\citet{sonkar-etal-2024-pedagogical}, and \\citet{wang-etal-2024-unleashing} draw on IS principles to craft pedagogically informed prompts, enabling LLMs to lead users or other models through intermediate steps toward task completion.\nOn the other hand, IS also offers a valuable conceptual lens for treating LLMs as adaptive learners that benefit from guided feedback.\nIn this paradigm, LLMs mirror students who improve through iterative supervision, corrections, and example-based guidance.\nSuch applications enhance the model\u2019s ability to internalize human preferences and refine performance over time.\nFor example, \\citet{tian-etal-2024-theory} and \\citet{wang-etal-2024-bridging} implement feedback-driven training and refinement loops that emulate scaffolded learning processes, allowing LLMs to self-correct and align more closely with desired outcomes.\n\n\n\n\\textbf{Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy (BT)} is a hierarchical educational theory that categorizes cognitive skills into progressive levels, aiming to promote deeper learning and critical thinking.\nIt serves as a foundational model for curriculum development, instructional design, and assessment strategies across educational settings, guiding learners from basic knowledge recall to advanced analytical and creative thinking.\nBT has been adopted in LLM research to guide the design and evaluation of model capabilities, and it was cited 35 times in the surveyed LLM research papers.\nBy providing a structured hierarchy of cognitive complexity, BT enhances the interpretability, rigor, and educational alignment of LLM-based benchmarks and evaluation methodologies.\nFor example, \\citet{10.5555/3737916.3739523}, \\citet{cao-etal-2024-structeval}, \\citet{wang-etal-2023-newton}, and \\citet{yu2024kola} reflect BT principles in benchmark construction, while \\citet{ying2024automating} incorporates BT into dynamic benchmarking strategies.\nOn the other hand, BT also serves as a conceptual lens for interpreting the internal structure of LLMs.\nFor example, \\citet{10.5555/3737916.3742165} explores how BT can shed light on the internal cognitive process of LLMs, and \\citet{wang-etal-2024-knowledge-mechanisms} draws on BT to investigate the underlying mechanisms of knowledge representation in language models.\n\n\n\n\\paragraph{Under-explored theories/frameworks}Under-explored theories/frameworks\n\nWe also list three other theories/frameworks that are closely related to the \\textit{Education} cluster but have received relatively little attention in current LLM studies.\n\n\n\n\\textbf{Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Systems Theory (BEST)} is a developmental theory that emphasizes the multiple layers of environmental influence on an individual\u2019s growth and behavior. \nIt outlines how individuals are embedded within a series of interrelated systems, ranging from immediate settings like family and school (microsystem) to broader societal and cultural forces (macrosystem). \nThe theory highlights the dynamic interactions between these systems and how changes in one layer can ripple through others, shaping developmental outcomes over time. \nBEST is widely applied in fields such as education, psychology, and public health to understand and support human development within context.\nIn LLM research, BEST can serve as a framework for contextualizing user interactions by considering the multilayered influences on user behavior and preferences. \nBy modeling users within their broader ecological environments, such as cultural norms, social relationships, and institutional contexts, LLMs can tailor their responses to better align with users\u2019 lived experiences, thereby enhancing relevance, empathy, and user engagement.\n\n\n\n\\textbf{Simple View of Reading (SVR)} is a theory that posits reading comprehension as the product of two primary components: decoding and linguistic comprehension. \nAccording to SVR, proficient reading occurs when individuals can accurately translate written symbols into spoken language (decoding) and effectively understand spoken language (comprehension).\nThis model has been widely supported in empirical research and is used to inform assessments and interventions for reading difficulties, such as dyslexia and language impairment.\nIn LLM research, SVR can serve as a framework for evaluating and enhancing models' reading comprehension abilities. \nBy separately analyzing a model's decoding-like abilities (e.g., text recognition and parsing) and its linguistic comprehension abilities (e.g., understanding semantics and context), researchers can better identify specific strengths and limitations. \nThis dual-component perspective can also guide the development of more targeted training strategies, improving both surface-level processing and deep understanding in LLM outputs.\n\n\n\n\\textbf{Self-Determination Theory (SDT)} is a theory that focuses on human motivation, emphasizing the role of innate psychological needs, autonomy, competence, and relatedness, in fostering self-motivated and healthy behavior.\nIt has been widely applied across various domains, including education, healthcare, workplace settings, and psychotherapy, demonstrating effectiveness in enhancing well-being, intrinsic motivation, and sustained behavior change.\nIn LLM research, SDT can serve as a guiding framework to promote user engagement and satisfaction by aligning model outputs with users\u2019 psychological needs. \nFor example, LLMs can support autonomy by offering choices or allowing users to guide the direction of interactions, enhance competence by providing clear, constructive feedback, and foster relatedness through empathetic and personalized responses. \nBy integrating SDT principles, LLMs can improve not only the effectiveness of user interactions but also long-term trust and continued use.\n\n\n\n\\begin{table}\n    \\small\n    \\centering\n    \\begin{tabular}{ll}\n    \\toprule\n

comprehension, pragmatic, and psycholinguistic}\\label{sec:5.2.3}\n\n\\paragraph{Popular theories/frameworks}Popular theories/frameworks\nIn the \\textit{Language} cluster, the three most frequently referenced psychology theories/frameworks in the surveyed LLM research papers are \\textit{Connectionism and Symbolism}~\\citep{faules1978sym,FODOR19883}, \\textit{Usage-based Models of Language}~\\citep{vonMengdenCouss\u00e9+2014+1+20}, and \\textit{Schema Theory}~\\citep{GRAESSER198259}.\nTheir citation distributions across the eight LLM research topics are shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:theory_2}.\n\n\n\n\\textbf{Connectionism and Symbolism} represent two contrasting approaches in cognitive science aimed at explaining human thought and information processing.\nConnectionism relies on artificial neural networks to model mental processes, highlighting the role of distributed, parallel processing and learning from experience. Rather than explicit symbols, knowledge in connectionist models is stored in the patterns of connections and activation across the network.\nIn contrast, Symbolism, also known as the rule-based approach, posits that cognition operates through the manipulation of discrete symbols according to formal rules, akin to programming languages or logical systems. It emphasizes structured representations and explicit reasoning mechanisms.\nWhile Connectionism offers strengths in pattern recognition, learning, and handling noisy or incomplete data, Symbolism excels at modeling rule-governed, high-level reasoning tasks.\nContemporary cognitive science often seeks integrative frameworks that draw upon the complementary strengths of both paradigms.\n\n\n\\textbf{Connectionism} serves as a foundational theory for understanding and designing neural architectures in LLMs.  \nThis theory directly informs research on the internal mechanics and adaptive capabilities of LLMs. \nFor example, work on model compression and pruning, such as \\citet{liu-etal-2024-llm} and \\citet{ma2023llmpruner}, leverages the connectionist notion of representational redundancy to identify and remove unnecessary parameters while preserving functionality. \nSimilarly, generalization studies like \\citet{10.5555/3692070.3692585}, \\citet{yang-etal-2024-unveiling}, and \\citet{10.5555/3692070.3694452} explore how internal patterns learned through training allow LLMs to extrapolate to novel linguistic tasks and inputs, reflecting classic connectionist learning dynamics. \nMoreover, work on emergent linguistic capabilities\u2014such as \\citet{de-varda-marelli-2023-scaling} and \\citet{10.5555/3618408.3619446}, illustrates how structured behaviors like syntax can arise from purely data-driven, neural processes, echoing one of Connectionism\u2019s core claims that complex cognition need not rely on explicit symbolic rules.\n\n\n\n\\textbf{Symbolism}, by contrast, has significantly influenced LLM research in areas that require explicit reasoning, compositional understanding, and interoperability. \nFor example, \\citet{yuan-etal-2024-chatmusician} uses symbolic representations to enable structured musical instruction following, while \\citet{tennenholtz2024demystifying} investigates how LLMs encode modular and interpretable meaning representations.\nIn formal linguistics, symbolic perspectives underpin works such as \\citet{de-dios-flores-etal-2023-dependency}, \\citet{minixhofer2023compoundpiece}, and \\citet{nair-resnik-2023-words}, which align LLM behavior with traditional linguistic theories involving morphology, syntax, and dependency structures. \nFurthermore, in mathematical and logical reasoning, rule-based symbolic models can help LLMs handle problems requiring multi-step, deterministic computation, as demonstrated by \\citet{imani-etal-2023-mathprompter} and \\citet{zheng2024take}. \n\n\n\n\\textbf{Usage-based Models of Language (UBML)} are theories that emphasize the role of actual language use in shaping linguistic knowledge and structure.\nGrounded in cognitive and functional approaches, UBML posits that language emerges from language users\u2019 repeated experiences with specific linguistic forms in meaningful contexts.\nThese models highlight how frequency, context, and communicative function influence language acquisition, processing, and change.\nUBML has been applied to a wide range of theoretical and applied domains in linguistics, including grammar development, lexical patterning, language variation, and second language acquisition.\nLLM researchers have drawn on the UBML to understand and model how patterns of language usage influence LLM behavior and capabilities. \nFor example, \\citet{zhang-etal-2023-dont} applies UBML theory to explain how LLM performance across different languages is shaped by the frequency of usage in training data. \nSimilarly, \\citet{zeng-etal-2024-johnny} leverages the UBML perspective that language use shapes understanding to highlight LLMs\u2019 sensitivity to communicative strategies. \nIn their work, LLMs are treated as human-like persuaders, and real-world rhetorical techniques, such as emotional appeals, appeals to authority, and logical reasoning, are employed to achieve jailbreaks.\nIn addition, LLM researchers also use UBML theories as a basis for designing evaluation tasks aimed at assessing the LLMs' language abilities. \nFor example, \\citet{wachowiak-gromann-2023-gpt} draws on one of the core UBML theories, conceptual metaphor theory, to develop tasks that test whether LLMs can learn metaphorical mappings.\n\n\n\n\\textbf{Schema Theory} is a theory that posits that individuals organize knowledge into mental structures called schemas, which shape how they perceive, interpret, and respond to experiences. \nThese schemas, developed through personal, social, and cultural narratives, guide meaning-making by filtering new information in accordance with existing beliefs and expectations.\nSchema theory explains how people construct coherence in stories, comprehend language, and derive significance from interactions by drawing upon pre-existing cognitive and cultural templates. \nSchema theory has been applied extensively in education and language learning to explain how learners use prior knowledge to comprehend new information.\nLLM researchers have drawn on schema theory to explore how LLMs emulate human-like reasoning and meaning construction through the activation of learned patterns.\nFor example, \\citet{sui-etal-2024-confabulation} leverages the schema theory principle of generating coherent narratives based on pre-existing structures to reinterpret hallucinations in LLMs as a form of schema-like reasoning with potential narrative value.\nSimilarly, \\citet{chen-etal-2024-generalizing} applies the schema activation mechanism to design a three-stage prompting framework (comprehend, associate, summarize) that simulates human cognitive processes to enhance generalization in multi-turn dialogue retrieval.\nIn addition, schema theory has also been used by LLM researchers as an evaluative framework to assess model abilities.\nFor example, \\citet{wicke-wachowiak-2024-exploring} based on schema theory\u2019s embodiment-oriented perspective to examine whether LLMs and VLMs can demonstrate human-like intuitions about spatial schemas (e.g., support, containment, path) in the absence of sensorimotor grounding.\n\n\n\n\\paragraph{Under-explored theories/frameworks}Under-explored theories/frameworks\n\nWe also list three other theories/frameworks that are closely related to the \\textit{Language} cluster but have received relatively little attention in current LLM studies.\n\n\n\n\\textbf{Predictive Coding (PC)} is a theory that posits the brain as a predictive machine, constantly generating and updating models to anticipate sensory input.\nIt emphasizes the interplay between top-down predictions and bottom-up sensory signals, where discrepancies drive learning and perception.\nPC has been influential in understanding perception, action, and cognition.\nIn LLM research, PC may inform the development of adaptive and context-aware models by treating dialogue as a dynamic process of prediction and error correction. \nBy modeling user inputs as sensory signals and the model\u2019s responses as top-down predictions, LLMs can iteratively refine their outputs based on user feedback and interaction history. \nThis approach may enhance responsiveness, coherence, and personalization, enabling models to better align with user expectations and reduce communicative mismatches over time.\n\n\n\n\\textbf{Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions Theory (HCDT)} is a theory for understanding cultural differences through six key dimensions that influence how individuals perceive and interact with the world. \nIt provides insights into national cultural values such as power distance, individualism vs. collectivism, masculinity vs. femininity, uncertainty avoidance, long-term orientation, and indulgence vs. restraint.\nHCDT serves as a valuable tool for navigating cross-cultural communication, enabling individuals and organizations to recognize and adapt to cultural nuances that affect communication styles, conflict resolution, leadership expectations, and collaboration in international or multicultural settings.\nIn LLM research, HCDT can inform the development of culturally adaptive dialogue systems that are sensitive to users\u2019 cultural backgrounds.\nBy incorporating insights from the six cultural dimensions, LLMs can tailor language, tone, and interaction strategies to align with users\u2019 communication preferences and expectations.\nThis cultural alignment can enhance user engagement, reduce misunderstandings, and foster greater trust and effectiveness in diverse human-AI interactions.\nMoreover, HCDT can serve as an evaluative framework to assess whether LLM-generated content appropriately reflects or adapts to cultural norms, providing a systematic way to analyze model performance across different cultural contexts.\n\n\n\n\\textbf{Grice's Cooperative Principle (GCP)} is a framework in pragmatics, explaining how effective and meaningful communication is achieved in conversation. \nGCP posits that speakers typically aim to be cooperative by contributing appropriately to the communicative context. \nThis principle is supported by four conversational maxims (Quantity, Quality, Relation, and Manner), which guide interlocutors to provide the right amount of information, to be truthful, relevant, and clear. \nGCP helps interpret implied meanings, identify conversational implicatures, and understand communication breakdowns when the maxims are flouted or violated.\nIn LLM research, the GCP may serve as a foundational principle for designing more natural and contextually appropriate interactions. \nBy aligning responses with the GCP framework, LLMs can enhance clarity, relevance, and trustworthiness in dialogue. \nMoreover, understanding when and how to strategically flout maxims (e.g., using understatement or irony) can help LLMs generate more nuanced and human-like communication.\nGCP may also serve as an evaluation framework for measuring the pragmatic appropriateness of LLM responses. \nThis involves assessing how well the model adheres to conversational maxims and whether it produces implicatures in a contextually coherent manner.\n\n\n\n\\begin{table}\n

cognition}\\label{sec:5.2.4}\n\n\\paragraph{Popular theories/frameworks}Popular theories/frameworks\nIn the \\textit{Social Cognition} cluster, the three most frequently referenced psychology theories/frameworks in the surveyed LLM research papers are \\textit{Theory of Mind}~\\citep[ToM;][]{Premack1978-PREDTC-3,10.1093/biohorizons/hzq011}, \\textit{Simulation Theory}~\\citep{Shanton2010Simulation}, and \\textit{Dual-Process Theory}~\\citep{gawronski2013dpt}.\nTheir citation distributions across the eight LLM research topics are shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:theory_3}.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figures/theory_3.pdf}\n    \\caption{Citation distribution for the top three theories/frameworks in the \\textit{Social Cognition} cluster across eight LLM research topics.}\n    \\label{fig:theory_3}\n\\end{figure}\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figures/theory_3.pdf}\n    \\caption{Citation distribution for the top three theories/frameworks in the \\textit{Social Cognition} cluster across eight LLM research topics.}\n    \\label{fig:theory_3}\n\n\n\\textbf{Theory of Mind (ToM)} is a psychology theory of the ability to understand other individuals by ascribing mental states to them. In ToM, others' beliefs, desires, intentions, emotions, and thoughts are recognized as potentially different from one\u2019s own. In other words, people use a theory of mind when analyzing, judging, and inferring others\u2019 behaviors; a well-functioning ToM is crucial for success in everyday social interactions.\nToM is the most frequently referenced theory/framework in the \\textit{Social Cognition} cluster, and it was cited 121 times in the surveyed LLM research papers.\nIn this cluster, LLM researchers have primarily drawn on ToM to interpret LLMs' social intelligence and their involvement in social interactions.\nFor example, various benchmarks (e.g.,~\\citealp{kim-etal-2023-fantom,sabour-etal-2024-emobench}) and tests (e.g.,~\\citealp{shapira-etal-2023-well}) were developed to examine LLMs' ToM capacity, which serves as a key indicator of their broader social intelligence. \nIn addition, some research has focused on LLMs' use of ToM in specific contexts.\nFor example, \\citet{zhao-etal-2024-large} evaluated LLM's ability to understand complex interpersonal relationships, \nand \\citet{xu-etal-2024-opentom} incorporated personalized mental states into ToM assessment.\nThere have also been analyses on ToM for goal-oriented dialogues.\n\\citet{10.5555/3692070.3692228,chan-etal-2024-negotiationtom,lai-etal-2023-werewolf} explored how effectively LLMs can negotiate and persuade using ToM, and\n\\citet{wu-etal-2023-hi} introduced a new deception mechanism within higher-order ToM reasoning.\n\n\n\n\\textbf{Simulation Theory (ST)} is a theory of how people understand others by engaging in a form of empathetic simulation. It posits that humans anticipate and make sense of others\u2019 behavior by internally simulating mental processes that, if enacted, would produce similar behaviors, such as intentional actions and emotional expressions.\nCompared to other theories of mind, ST draws more heavily on biological evidence. It has been applied across fields such as cognitive science, neuroscience, developmental psychology, and clinical research.\nIn LLM research, ST forms a key foundation for AI empathy and other advanced social skills, and it received 113 citations from the surveyed LLM research papers. \nFor instance, \\citet{qian-etal-2023-harnessing} explored the role of ST in LLMs' empathetic responses, and \\citet{shen-etal-2024-heart} conducted an empirical analysis with LLMs examining the relationship between empathy and narrative style in storytelling.\nTheir research has leveraged ST in empathy modeling, and \\citet{nie2023moca} examined the influence of ST on how LLMs make correct moral judgment.\nFurthermore, a sub-concept of ST called perspective-taking has been studied in LLMs. According to ST, it refers to the ability to understand a situation or concept from another person's point of view.\n\\citet{wilf-etal-2024-think} demonstrated that perspective-taking can effectively enhance LLMs' performance in mental state attribution, while \\citet{xu-etal-2024-walking} incorporated it into prompting and highlighted its significance in reducing bias and toxicity in LLMs.\nThese findings indicate that ST may serve as a viable guide for developing more socially aware AI systems.\n\n\n\n\\textbf{Dual-Process Theory (DPT)} is a theory that explains how thought can arise in two distinct ways: System 1 and System 2. \nSystem 1 processes are implicit and unconscious, and may be influenced by persuasion or education;\nSystem 2 processes are explicit and conscious, typically requiring more time to adapt to different situations.\nThese theories can be found in social, personality, cognitive, and clinical psychology, where the different modes of thinking are used to explain various phenomena. \nLLM researchers have primarily drawn on DPT to analyze and mitigate some social issues raised by these models, resulting in 103 citations among the surveyed LLM research papers.\nFor instance, \\citet{sui-etal-2024-confabulation} referred to DPT when accounting for hallucinations in LLMs, and \\citet{echterhoff-etal-2024-cognitive,koo-etal-2024-benchmarking} argued that both social and cognitive biases may stem from unconscious processes within LLMs, which parallel the System 1 processes described in DPT. \nTheir work emphasizes the need for conscious audition to mitigate these problems.\nMeanwhile, inspired by DPT, researchers have found it effective to influence patterns of thinking and behavior in LLMs through the use of personas.\n\\citet{sun-etal-2024-kiss} assigned different visual personas to MLLMs and observed corresponding behavioral changes.\n\\citet{hu-collier-2024-quantifying} quantified the impact of assigned personas on perspective simulation.\n\\citet{liu-etal-2024-evaluating-large} further evaluated the resulting social bias and steerability induced by different persona assignments.\n\n\n\n\\paragraph{Under-explored theories/frameworks}Under-explored theories/frameworks\n\nWe also list three other theories/frameworks that are closely related to the \\textit{Social Cognition} cluster but have received relatively little attention in current LLM studies.\n\n\n\n\\textbf{Cognitive Dissonance Theory (CDT)} is a theory that focuses on the mental discomfort individuals experience when holding two or more conflicting cognitions, such as beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors. \nCDT posits that this dissonance motivates individuals to reduce the inconsistency, often by altering existing beliefs, justifying behaviors, or acquiring new information. \nCDT has been widely applied to understand processes like attitude change, decision-making, moral reasoning, and behavioral justification across various domains, such as consumer behavior, health psychology, and social dynamics.\nIn LLM research, CDT can be used as a theoretical framework for understanding user resistance to model suggestions, particularly when those suggestions conflict with users\u2019 prior beliefs or intentions.\nBy modeling and anticipating dissonant reactions, LLMs can be designed to offer responses that reduce psychological discomfort, for example, by providing justifications, alternative framings, or gradual nudges toward behavior change.\nAdditionally, CDT can serve as an evaluation lens to assess how well LLM outputs align with users\u2019 cognitive states and to measure whether interactions successfully reduce dissonance over time, thereby enhancing long-term trust and acceptance.\n\n\n\n\\textbf{Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM)} is a theory of persuasion that explains how individuals process and respond to persuasive messages through two distinct routes, the central route and the peripheral route. \nThe central route involves careful and thoughtful consideration of the message content, typically occurring when the individual is motivated and able to engage in deep cognitive processing.\nIn contrast, the peripheral route relies on superficial cues, such as the speaker\u2019s credibility, attractiveness, or emotional appeal, when motivation or ability to process is low. \nELM provides a comprehensive framework for understanding attitude change, highlighting that the durability and strength of persuasion depend on the route through which it is achieved. \nIt has been widely applied in areas such as marketing, health communication, and political campaigning.\nIn LLM research, the ELM can serve as a framework for designing adaptive communication strategies based on user engagement levels.\nBy assessing users\u2019 motivation and ability to process information, LLMs can tailor their responses to either follow the central route, providing detailed, logical arguments for highly engaged users; or the peripheral route, using concise, emotionally resonant cues for less engaged users.\nThis approach may ensure that model outputs are better aligned with users\u2019 cognitive states.\nAdditionally, the ELM can be used as an evaluative lens to assess the quality and impact of LLM-generated persuasive content, guiding improvements in user experience and behavioral outcomes.\n\n\n\n\\textbf{Realistic Conflict Theory (RCT)} is a theory that explains intergroup conflict as arising from competition over limited resources. \nIt posits that when groups perceive that they are in direct competition for resources such as jobs, power, or territory, hostility and prejudice are likely to emerge. \nRCT emphasizes the role of tangible, real-world conflicts of interest in generating negative intergroup attitudes and behaviors. \nRCT has been applied to understand a variety of social phenomena, including ethnic tensions, discrimination, and political polarization.\nIn LLM research, RCT may be used as a framework to analyze user interactions in competitive or zero-sum environments, such as online debates or resource allocation scenarios. \nBy modeling how perceived intergroup threats influence communication patterns, developers can design LLMs that detect emerging conflicts and facilitate constructive dialogue. \nAdditionally, RCT may inform the evaluation of LLM outputs in sensitive contexts by assessing whether responses exacerbate or mitigate perceived competition and group-based tensions.\n\n\\begin{table}\n    \\small\n    \\centering\n    \\begin{tabular}{ll}\n    \\toprule\n    \\textbf{Sub-Topic} & \\textbf{Theory/Framework} \\\\\n    \\midrule\n

cognitive mechanisms of learning and creativity}\\label{sec:5.2.5}\n\n\\paragraph{Popular theories/frameworks}Popular theories/frameworks\nIn the \\textit{Neural Mechanisms} cluster, the three most frequently referenced psychology theories/frameworks in the surveyed LLM research papers are \\textit{Executive Functions}~\\citep{Diamond2013Executive}, \\textit{Theory of Mind}~\\citep[ToM;][]{Premack1978-PREDTC-3,10.1093/biohorizons/hzq011}, and \\textit{Theory-Theory}~\\citep{Ratcliffe2006}.\nTheir citation distributions across the eight LLM research topics are shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:theory_4}.\n\n\\textbf{Executive Functions (EFs)} are a framework of cognitive processes that support goal-directed behavior, in which higher-order EFs require the coordinated use of multiple basic ones. \nAll these functions develop gradually over the lifespan and can be improved at any point in a person\u2019s life, though they may be adversely affected by various affective factors.\nThey play a fundamental role in people's actions and are deeply intertwined with domains such as mental health, social functioning, and academic achievement.\nEFs have been widely studied in education, clinical psychology, neuroscience, workplace settings, and public health and policy, particularly in terms of how they can be improved and maintained, as well as how they contribute to various forms of goal-directed behavior.\nEFs are the most frequently referenced theory/framework in the \\textit{Neural Mechanisms} cluster.\nLLM researchers have primarily drawn on EFs to enhance LLMs\u2019 capabilities for corresponding behaviors, resulting in 197 citations among surveyed LLM research papers.\nFor example, higher-order EFs like problem-solving (e.g.,~\\citealp{didolkar2024metacognitive,yao2023tree}) and planning (e.g.,~\\citealp{hao2023reasoning,10.5555/3692070.3694316}) have become key areas in LLM reasoning.\nMeanwhile, some foundational EFs, though less extensively studied, have also been explored as a means to support the development of higher-level capabilities in LLMs. \nFor instance, both working memory\u2019s essential role in LLMs\u2019 reasoning abilities (e.g., \\citet{wu2024minds,zhang-etal-2024-working}) and cognitive flexibility\u2019s underpinning of their adaptive, context-sensitive behavior (e.g., \\citealp{dong-etal-2023-steerlm,shao-etal-2023-character}) have been empirically demonstrated.\nIn addition to these main EFs, \\citet{ren-xiong-2023-huaslim} leveraged attention control to inhibit irrational shortcut learning, thus enhancing models' generalization.\n\n\n\n\\textbf{Theory of Mind (ToM)}, the previously mentioned cognitive ability to attribute mental states, is supported by a dedicated network of brain regions and underlying EFs. \nResearch on ToM in autism indicates that these specialized mechanisms can, in some cases, be selectively impaired while general cognitive function remains largely intact.\nNeuroimaging studies further evidence the view, showing that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), the precuneus, and the amygdala are involved in ToM-related activities~\\citep{tommechanisms}, such as social reasoning and decision-making.\nTherefore, in addition to its role in social reasoning, ToM has been adopted in LLM research to guide the exploration and enhancement of underlying reasoning mechanisms.\nIn the psychology cluster of \\textit{Neural Mechanisms}, the 188 citations of ToM are heavily concentrated in \\textit{Advanced Reasoning} among the eight LLM research topics, exhibiting a distribution different from that shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:theory_3}.\nA mainstream direction involves analyzing the mechanisms of LLM's social reasoning. For example, \\citet{huang-etal-2024-notion} measured the complexity of different ToM tasks for LLMs, drawing on cognitive load theory.\n\\citet{10.5555/3692070.3694663} linearly decoded LLMs\u2019 representations of their own and others\u2019 belief states from neural activations, adopting a connectionist perspective, while \\citet{jung-etal-2024-perceptions} evaluated the precursory inferences for ToM in LLMs to further develop their ToM abilities, adopting a symbolic perspective.\nAnother branch involves applying ToM to multi-agent interactions.\nThis includes LLM collaboration, where the ToMs of different agents are integrated through synergy into a unified system (e.g.,\\citealp{li-etal-2023-theory,wang-etal-2024-unleashing}), \nand competition, where the ToMs of different agents are better differentiated and strengthened (e.g.,\\citealp{10.5555/3692070.3692537,wu-etal-2024-deciphering,xu-etal-2024-magic}).\n\n\n\n\\textbf{Theory-Theory (TT)} is a theory concerning how humans develop an understanding of the outside world. \nWhile it shares with ToM the assumption that individuals possess a basic or na\u00efve theory of psychology (i.e., folk psychology) to infer others\u2019 mental states, TT is better understood as a broader framework for learning rather than a specific cognitive ability. \nIt extends beyond reasoning about people and their viewpoints to include understanding mechanical devices and other non-agentive objects.\nTT has been widely studied in developmental psychology, education, cognitive modeling, social psychology, and domain-specific reasoning.\nFrom the perspective of TT, folk psychology, or the explanatory mental models in LLMs, is built through inductive reasoning. \nLLM researchers have primarily drawn on TT to enhance LLMs' capabilities in inductive reasoning and causal inference, resulting in 151 citations among the surveyed LLM research papers.\nFor example, \\citet{wang2024hypothesis} proposed a pipeline for complex abstract hypothesis generation;\n\\citet{shani-etal-2023-towards} and \\citet{suresh-etal-2023-conceptual} mirrored TT to interrogate LLMs' latent structure of conceptual representations, thereby achieving concept awareness;\nand \\citet{jiayang-etal-2023-storyanalogy} and \\citet{wijesiriwardene-etal-2023-analogical} evaluated LLMs across text analogies at various levels, ranging from words and sentences to metaphors and stories.\nThese processes contribute to improved LLM performance in inductive reasoning tasks.\nFurthermore, \\citet{liu-etal-2023-magic} and \\citet{nie2023moca} drew on TT when investigating LLMs\u2019 ability to derive cause-effect relationships.\n\n\n\n\\paragraph{Under-explored theories/frameworks}Under-explored theories/frameworks\n\nWe also list three other theories/frameworks that are closely related to the \\textit{Neural Mechanisms} cluster but have received relatively little attention in current LLM studies.\n\n\n\n\\textbf{Levels of Processing Model (LPM)} is a framework that posits memory retention is influenced by the depth at which information is processed. \nRather than focusing on separate memory stores, the model emphasizes the continuum of processing levels, ranging from shallow (e.g., perceptual or structural features) to deep (e.g., semantic meaning and personal relevance). \nDeeper levels of processing lead to more durable and accessible memory traces. \nLPM has been influential in understanding encoding mechanisms and has implications for educational practices, memory enhancement strategies, and interventions for memory-related disorders.\nIn LLM research, LPM holds great potential for enhancing the general learning process. \nWhether a similar mapping between levels of processing and memory duration exists in LLMs is worth investigating.\nIf so, the three levels of processing (i.e., structural/visual, phonemic, and semantic) correspond to three modalities, which may inspire new learning algorithms for MLLMs. \nFor example, LPM may serve as a guide for data administration at various training stages to mitigate forgetting or imbalance across different modalities.\nMoreover, if we further abstract the mapping in LPM, a conceptual parallel may emerge between the depth of human processing and the layers in deep neural models. \nBy leveraging LPM-like mappings as heuristics in model adaptation, more PEFT methods become possible from an information processing perspective.\nMeanwhile, from a memory duration perspective, the personalization of LLMs can be effectively managed to balance steerability and stability.\n\n\n\n\\textbf{Piaget\u2019s Stage Theory of Cognitive Development (PSTCD)} is a theory that outlines how children's thinking evolves through a series of qualitatively distinct stages, each characterized by different cognitive abilities. \nPSTCD posits that children actively construct knowledge as they interact with their environment, progressing through four stages: sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational. \nEach stage represents a shift in how children understand and engage with the world, highlighting the importance of maturation and experience in cognitive growth. \nPSTCD has significantly influenced educational practices and our understanding of child development.\nIn LLM research, PSTCD may serve as a valuable conceptual framework for modeling human-like learning trajectories. \nBy incorporating the stage-based characteristics of cognitive development, researchers may design training curricula that progress from simple, concrete tasks to more abstract, logical reasoning, mirroring the natural evolution of human cognition. \nFurthermore, aligning interaction strategies with different cognitive stages allows LLMs to generate age-appropriate and educationally tailored responses, making them more effective for personalized learning environments. \nPSTCD also offers a structured lens for evaluating a model's cognitive maturity, guiding the design of benchmarks that reflect developmental reasoning skills.\n\n\n\n\\textbf{Hebbian Theory (HT)} is a theory that emphasizes the role of synaptic plasticity in learning and memory. \nHT posits that the repeated and persistent activation of one neuron by another strengthens the connection between them, thereby shaping neural networks.\nHT has been influential in understanding brain development, learning processes.\nIn LLM research, HT may offer valuable inspiration for understanding and designing learning mechanisms. \nHT's core idea, neurons that fire together, wire together, has influenced the development of neural networks by introducing local learning rules and concepts of synaptic plasticity. \nThese ideas may support the exploration of more biologically plausible and interpretable models. \nFurthermore, HT emphasizes associative memory, may offer insights into how LLMs might enhance their capacity for long-term memory and contextual association. \nThis may have implications for future architectures, such as neuromorphic computing and memory-augmented models, where energy-efficient and adaptive learning processes are increasingly important.\n\n\n\n\\begin{table}\n    \\small\n    \\centering\n    \\begin{tabular}{ll}\n    \\toprule\n    \\textbf{Sub-Topic} & \\textbf{Theory/Framework} \\\\\n    \\midrule\n

decision-making}\\label{sec:5.2.6}\n\n\\paragraph{Popular theories/frameworks}Popular theories/frameworks\nIn the \\textit{Psychometrics \\& JDM} cluster, the three most frequently referenced psychology theories/frameworks in the surveyed LLM research papers are \\textit{Dual-Process Theory}~\\citep{gawronski2013dpt}, \\textit{Heuristics-and-Biases Program}~\\citep{doi:10.1126/science.185.4157.1124}, and \\textit{Classical Test Theory}~\\citep[CTT;][]{lord1968statistical,NOVICK19661}.\nTheir citation distributions across the eight LLM research topics are shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:theory_5}.\n\n\n\n\\textbf{Dual-Process Theory (DPT)}, previously mentioned as the theory that partitions human cognition into two distinct types of processes, has significantly influenced studies of executive control, reward-based learning, and judgment and decision-making.\nAccording to some researchers, System 1 and System 2 do not operate as parallel systems~\\citep{thinkingstraight}. \nTypically, System 1 generates intuitive responses, which are then monitored and evaluated by System 2. However, System 2 does not always override System 1, especially under time pressure, cognitive load, or distraction.\nThis has inspired LLM researchers to propose that not only social interactions but also a broader range of LLMs' behaviors can be moderated and steered through DPT and related frameworks.\nIn the \\textit{Psychometrics \\& JDM} cluster, DPT is the most frequently cited psychology theory/framework, with 236 citations across the surveyed LLM research papers. \nFor example, \\citet{yao2023tree} incorporated planning processes into general problem-solving, \\citet{dziri2023faith} used computation graphs for compositional tasks, and \\citet{xu-etal-2024-faithful} applied chain-of-thought reasoning in logical reasoning.\nTheir research improves LLMs' decision-making by introducing a conscious, explicit guide to assist the unconscious, greedy processes.\nThis comparison of LLMs' original cognitive processes to \\textit{System 1} in DPT is supported by evidence that LLMs can be easily persuaded (e.g.,~\\citealp{xie2024adaptive,xu-etal-2024-earth}).\n\\citet{goldstein-etal-2023-decoding} provides further evidence that LLMs\u2019 limited verification capability corresponds to \\textit{System 2}.\nGiven this similarity, the trade-off between the two systems has invited discussions about consistency and uncertainty in LLMs (e.g.,~\\citealp{jang-lukasiewicz-2023-consistency,yona-etal-2024-large}), particularly when dealing with knowledge conflicts. \n\n\n\n\\textbf{Heuristics and Biases Program (HBP)} is a research framework that investigates how people rely on heuristics to make decisions under uncertainty, and how these heuristics can lead to systematic errors or cognitive biases.\nHeuristics refers to the process by which humans use mental shortcuts to quickly arrive at judgments, decisions, and even solutions to complex problems.\nIn the early 1970s, it became closely associated with cognitive biases through a series of experiments, demonstrating that people\u2019s intuitive judgments often deviated from normative rules.\nHBP informs research and practice in behavioral economics, clinical psychology, law, public policy, education, and organizational management.\nLLM researchers have mainly drawn on HBP to reveal how heuristics shape decision-making and how to mitigate related biases.\nHBP received 210 citations from the surveyed LLM research papers, most of which fall within the \\textit{Bias, Morality \\& Culture} cluster.\nFor instance, \\citet{echterhoff-etal-2024-cognitive} identified cognitive biases in LLMs under high-stakes scenarios and proposed a strategy for the models to mitigate their own human-like biases; \\citet{jiang-etal-2024-peek} assessed whether LLMs possess genuine reasoning abilities or primarily depend on token bias.\nOn the other hand, heuristics have been shown to be valuable for boosting the efficiency of LLMs in search (e.g.,~\\citealp{gupta-li-2024-training,yao2023tree}) and reasoning (e.g.,~\\citealp{bertolazzi-etal-2024-systematic,pan-etal-2024-dynathink}). \nThese heuristic approaches either mimic human heuristics or rely on computational strategies to balance performance and cost, while \\citet{zhou-etal-2024-llms} also validated that LLMs can automatically acquire task-specific heuristics from in-context demonstrations.\n\n\n\n\\textbf{Classical Test Theory (CTT)} is a psychometric theory concerned with predicting outcomes of psychological tests, such as item difficulty and examinee ability. \nIt is based on the idea that a person\u2019s observed score on a test is the sum of a true score (the error-free score) and an error score. \nThe aim of CTT is to understand and improve the reliability of psychological assessments, that is, to ensure test scores are precise, reproducible, and consistent across different testing conditions.\nLLM researchers have extensively adopted CTT in the design of evaluation methods, resulting in 145 citations among the surveyed papers.\nMany existing LLM evaluation methods \\textit{de facto} follow the logic of CTT implicitly, testing models with a range of items and reporting average scores (e.g.,~\\citealp{manakul-etal-2023-selfcheckgpt,10.5555/3666122.3668142}). \nThis is due to the straightforward assumptions of CTT, including the decomposition into true scores and errors, the linear and additive nature of the model, and the homogeneity of test items.\nNonetheless, only a little research (e.g.,~\\citealp{cao-etal-2024-structeval,forde-etal-2024-evaluating,li-etal-2024-split}) formalizes error variance or true score modeling as CTT would.\nMoreover, some research has indicated that CTT would be less reliable for evaluating LLMs given its simple assumptions. \nFor example, \\citet{xiao-etal-2023-evaluating-evaluation} observed noise in true score and error modeling, and proposed a testing framework to measure both the reliability and validity of NLG metrics.\n\\citet{kobayashi-etal-2024-revisiting} proposed a benchmark that combines test items of varying evaluation granularity, aiming to mitigate inconsistencies across different tests.\nThe context-sensitivity of LLMs and the nuanced nature of test items motivate the development of more context-aware, item-level, and dynamic measurements.\n\n\n\n\\paragraph{Under-explored theories/frameworks}Under-explored theories/frameworks\n\nWe also list three other theories/frameworks that are closely related to the \\textit{Psychometrics \\& JDM} cluster but have received relatively little attention in current LLM studies.\n\n\n\n\\textbf{Lincoln and Guba's Evaluative Criteria (LGEC)} is a framework for assessing the trustworthiness of qualitative research. \nLEGC emphasizes the importance of rigor through four key dimensions: credibility, transferability, dependability, and confirmability. \nThese criteria serve as qualitative counterparts to the concepts of internal validity, external validity, reliability, and objectivity in quantitative research. \nThe framework aims to ensure that qualitative findings are both believable and applicable, offering researchers a systematic approach to evaluating and enhancing the quality of their work.\nIn LLM research, LGEC may guide the evaluation of model-generated qualitative outputs, such as LLM-as-judge for narrative responses, user reflections, or topic modeling.\nBy applying these criteria, researchers can assess whether the responses produced by LLMs are contextually relevant (transferable), logically consistent (dependable), and grounded in source data or reasoning (confirmable), thereby enhancing the trustworthiness and practical value of AI-driven qualitative analysis.\n\n\n\n\\textbf{Prospect Theory (PT)} is a theory that describes how individuals make decisions under conditions of risk and uncertainty, highlighting the psychological biases that diverge from rational choice. \nPT emphasizes that people evaluate potential losses and gains relative to a reference point, and that losses typically loom larger than equivalent gains (known as loss aversion). \nPT has been instrumental in explaining real-world decision-making patterns in areas such as finance, consumer behavior, and public policy.\nIn LLM research, PT offers valuable insights for modeling and simulating human decision-making under uncertainty. \nBy incorporating key principles such as loss aversion and reference dependence, LLMs can better reflect the psychological biases that influence human judgment. \nThis is particularly useful in areas like dialogue generation, recommendation systems, and behavior prediction, where understanding users' risk preferences enhances personalization and realism. \nPT may also inform the design of reward functions in reinforcement learning from human feedback, enabling LLMs to align more closely with real-world human values and sensitivities.\nFurthermore, PT-guided framing strategies may improve the persuasive impact of generated content in domains like marketing, public policy, and healthcare communication. \n\n\n\n\\textbf{Framing Theory (FT)} is a theory that explores how information presentation influences individuals\u2019 perception and interpretation of events, issues, and messages. \nFT emphasizes the role of context, language, and emphasis in shaping meaning, guiding attention, and influencing emotional and behavioral responses. \nBy highlighting certain aspects of a message while downplaying others, framing can significantly affect public opinion, decision-making, and social discourse.\nFT has been widely applied in media studies, political communication, public health campaigns, and social movement research.\nIn LLM research, FT may offer valuable insights into how the presentation of prompts, context, and language influences model outputs. \nBy highlighting the importance of emphasis, wording, and contextual cues, FT helps explain why different phrasings of the same question can lead to significantly varied responses from a model.\nThis has implications for prompt engineering, bias detection, and user experience design. \nFT also aids in analyzing the latent frames within training data, which may introduce subtle biases into model behavior. \nFurthermore, FT may help researchers to explore public reactions under various narrative styles and assess emotional tone. \nSuch as research on persuasive strategies in human-AI interaction can draw on this theory to examine how language framing influences user compliance and perception.\n\\subsection{How is psychology research operationalized and interpreted in the context of LLM research?}\\label{sec:5.3}\n\n\n\nIn \u00a7\\ref{sec:5.2}, we provided an overview and analysis of the psychology theories/frameworks cited in LLM research. \nBuilding on that foundation, this section further explores how LLM research concretely operationalizes and interprets the psychology literature, theories, and frameworks it references. \nUnlike the more macro-level overview in \u00a7\\ref{sec:5.2}, the focus here is on the specific ways LLM research applies these psychological insights in practice, including potential misapplications or oversights.\n\nGiven the varying theoretical depth and scope of different psychology research, it is inevitable that LLM research exhibits diverse approaches to its application. \nTherefore, we adopt a case study approach to closely examine how the particular theory/framework is cited and used. \nConsidering that ToM is one of the most commonly referenced psychology concepts in LLM research, we select ToM as a central case for in-depth analysis.\n\nAlthough LLM research displays considerable variation in how it references different psychology theories, there are common patterns of misapplication in operationalization and theoretical understanding.\nThrough the analysis of the ToM case, we aim to reveal these shared issues and offer insights for more rigorous and accurate incorporation of psychology research into LLM studies.\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Case study: Theory of Mind}\\label{sec:5.3.1}\n\nAs introduced in \u00a7\\ref{sec:5.2}, Theory of Mind (ToM) refers to the capacity of individuals to attribute mental states such as beliefs, intentions, knowledge, and emotions to others, recognizing that these states may differ from their own.\nThis concept has become an important focus in LLM research, as it reflects the models\u2019 potential to comprehend and reason about complex human mental states, which is considered essential for the development of more advanced and human-like artificial intelligence systems.\nAs discussed in \u00a7\\ref{sec:5.2}, ToM is among the three most influential theories/frameworks cited in LLM research, drawing from the \\textit{Social Cognition} and \\textit{Neural Mechanisms} clusters within psychology research.\nWe conducted a comprehensive analysis of LLM papers that reference ToM-related works from these two clusters.\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.8\\linewidth]{figures/tom.pdf}\n    \\caption{Bipartite Network of Citations Linking LLM Research Papers to Psychology Papers on Theory of Mind. \\\\ \\textit{Note:} Line opacity reflects citation frequency, and the color of LLM research topics indicates the proportion of citations to psychology papers in the two clusters.}\n    \\label{fig:case_tom}\n\\end{figure}\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.8\\linewidth]{figures/tom.pdf}\n    \\caption{Bipartite Network of Citations Linking LLM Research Papers to Psychology Papers on Theory of Mind. \\\\ \\textit{Note:} Line opacity reflects citation frequency, and the color of LLM research topics indicates the proportion of citations to psychology papers in the two clusters.}\n    \\label{fig:case_tom}\n\n\n\n\nToM-related psychology papers within the \\textit{Social Cognition} and \\textit{Neural Mechanisms} clusters show clear differences in research orientation and methodological approaches. \nResearch in the \\textit{Social Cognition} cluster primarily focuses on the role of ToM in social interactions, emphasizing its relationships with abilities such as emotion understanding, social reasoning, empathy, and moral judgment. \nThese studies often employ behavioral experiments, questionnaires, or situational tasks, highlighting the influence of developmental processes and social environmental factors on ToM.\nIn contrast, research in the \\textit{Neural Mechanisms} cluster is more concerned with the biological foundation of ToM, exploring activation patterns in relevant brain regions (such as the prefrontal cortex and the temporoparietal junction) during ToM tasks. \nThese studies commonly use techniques like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG), following a neuroscience-oriented paradigm and focusing more on revealing the neural structure and functional mechanisms of ToM.\nTherefore, the way LLM research references and uses ToM-related papers from different clusters also tends to differ.\n\n\n\nWhen LLM research references studies from the \\textit{Social Cognition} cluster, it primarily draws on established experimental tasks and research paradigms from that field as tools to evaluate the model's ``ToM-like'' abilities.\nFor example, researchers often borrow tasks like the False Belief Task (e.g., the classic Sally-Anne test) to assess whether a model can distinguish between a character's perspective and reality. \nOther common tests like the Smarties test (first-order) and the Ice Cream Van test (second-order) are also used to evaluate whether the model can maintain mental state modeling across multiple dialogue turns.\nAdditionally, some LLM studies adapt situational attribution tasks, narrative comprehension tasks, and social reasoning tasks to examine whether a model can grasp implicit intentions, emotional shifts, or social norms of characters. \nThese tasks offer a structured and comparable framework for assessing LLMs.\n\n\n\nWhen LLM research references studies from the \\textit{Neural Mechanisms} cluster, the primary focus is on how ToM is supported at the neural level, as well as the mechanisms and biological foundations underlying how some individuals process others' mental states.\nThis includes examining the functional differentiation of brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex and temporoparietal junction in tasks like attribution, behavior prediction, and emotion understanding.\nInspired by these studies, LLM researchers design new architectures for LLMs, develop multi-agent systems/frameworks, and seek to explain model behaviors.\nFor example, some LLM researchers introduce processes analogous to ToM by incorporating concept-level representations during training, which they want to allow models to develop an understanding of concepts prior to engaging in tasks like language generation or comprehension.\nAnother example is LLM researchers inspired by the structure of social cognitive networks in neuroscience to structure the multi-agent systems, where each agent simulates the mental state of a specific role.\n\n\n\n\\paragraph{Common misapplication}Common misapplication \nIn addition to the above discussion on how ToM is used in LLM research, we have identified four common types of misuse when citing ToM-related papers. \nAlthough these misuses specifically occur in the context of referencing ToM works, they also reflect broader issues in how current LLM research draws on findings from psychology research. \n\n\n\n\\begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt,left=8pt,itemsep=0pt]\n\\item \\textbf{Conceptual overgeneralization and misclassification} \nOne of the most common misuses in LLM research when citing ToM-related papers is the overgeneralization and misclassification of the ToM concept.\nResearchers often reference psychology research on ToM without sufficiently attending to the original studies' specific research designs, populations, and experimental conclusions. \nAs a result, ToM is frequently treated as a catch-all label, with key distinctions between task types and cognitive processes overlooked.\nIdeally, when citing a paper, researchers should clearly convey the study's core findings and scope of applicability, then thoughtfully relate these to the observed behaviors or capacities of LLMs. \nHowever, many LLM studies adopt ToM-related terminology, such as belief reasoning, perspective-taking, or false belief tasks, without a deep understanding of the cited studies.\nA common example of such conceptual overgeneralization is the failure to distinguish between different levels of mental-state reasoning tasks, such as first-order and second-order ToM, referring to them broadly as ``ToM tasks'' without clarifying their differing cognitive demands and underlying psychological mechanisms. \nFor instance, some studies treat the Sally-Anne task (a first-order false belief task) and the Ice Cream Van task (a second-order false belief task) as equivalent tests of ToM when evaluating whether LLMs possess ToM abilities. \nYet in psychology, these tasks are clearly differentiated: the former requires understanding that someone can hold a false belief about the world, while the latter involves reasoning about someone's belief about another person's belief (i.e., a recursive representation of mental states).\nLLM researchers need to reflect more deeply on why a particular paper is being cited over others, and what specific conclusions or experimental designs from that study meaningfully contribute to LLM research.\n\n\n\nIn addition, there is a tendency in some LLM research to mistakenly categorize psychology studies that were not originally intended to explore ToM as supporting evidence for ToM. \nFor example, studies focusing on emotion recognition, social attention, or attribution mechanisms are sometimes included in discussions of ToM. \nAlthough these studies are indeed related to social cognition, they do not strictly fall within the core components of ToM, especially when they do not involve recursive belief construction or the understanding of mental states. \nFor example, emotion recognition and belief attribution are distinct psychological processes. \nThe former relies more on perception, while the latter involves recursive modeling of mental states. \nThis practice may stem from a vague understanding of what constitutes ToM, or from a selective interpretation of psychology research when constructing arguments, thereby weakening the conceptual rigor of ToM in interdisciplinary research.\n\n\n\n\\item \\textbf{Partial or incomplete citation} \nAnother common misuse is that when citing psychology research on ToM, researchers often only select a few well-known studies while overlooking other equally important but less ``representative'' work in the field. \nWe understand that citing well-known papers helps strengthen the credibility and authority of a paper, especially in literature reviews or theoretical frameworks, where referencing widely recognized classic studies can build a solid academic foundation.\nHowever, this practice can also lead to a narrow research perspective and neglect the diversity of findings within the field.\nIn fact, some less ``representative'' studies, although less well-known, still offer valuable contributions that complement, challenge, or deepen mainstream views through their methods, samples, or conclusions. \nThese can be especially useful as references for certain types of LLM research on ToM.\nFor example, most LLM studies referencing psychology research on ToM often cite~\\citet{Premack1978-PREDTC-3} work on whether chimpanzees possess ToM, or~\\citet{BARONCOHEN198537} study on ToM in children with autism.\nAlthough these studies are undoubtedly milestones in ToM research history, they may not always be the most suitable for exploring ToM in the context of LLMs. \nSpecifically, some LLM-related studies want to examine how reasoning abilities evolve across different training stages or attempt to break down the model's ``ToM-like'' capabilities into multiple levels for analysis.\nIn this context, the study by~\\citet{wellman2004scaling} on the developmental progression of ToM may offer more relevant insights. \nTheir research designed a set of hierarchically structured tasks to demonstrate that children's ToM abilities develop gradually through several stages. \nThis phased, progressive perspective aligns more closely with how LLMs' capabilities are described and offers a more structured theoretical framework for refining the analysis of ``ToM-like'' abilities.\n\n\n\nMoreover, this emphasis on well-known research has led LLM research to primarily draw on a limited number of widely cited experimental findings, while overlooking many studies that also hold significant theoretical value and experimental insight. \nFor example, \\citet{apperly2006belief} found that even adults do not automatically engage ToM abilities in certain contexts; instead, they rely on cognitive control resources to perform reasoning tasks about mental states.\nThis finding can be important for understanding the conditions under which LLMs might exhibit an active use of ToM-like abilities. \nSimilarly, \\citet{onishi200515}, using the violation of expectation paradigm with infants, demonstrated that sensitivity to others' belief states may emerge at an earlier developmental stage than previously thought.\nThis provides empirical support for the concept of ``early ToM'' and offers valuable clues for exploring whether LLMs might develop some form of ToM processing during pretraining. \nAlthough these less frequently cited studies are not as widely known as classic experiments by \\citet{BARONCOHEN198537} or \\citet{Premack1978-PREDTC-3}, they offer unique value to current LLM research in terms of methodology, theoretical perspective, and task design. \nContinued neglect of such studies in LLM research risks missing important opportunities to deepen our understanding of ToM-like capabilities in LLM research.\n\n\n\n\\item \\textbf{Misinterpretation or misrepresentation of findings} \nMisinterpretation of cited psychology research is also a common issue in LLM research. \nThis may have led some LLM studies to cite inappropriate papers to support certain arguments. \nThis problem may stem from a lack of disciplinary sensitivity among LLM researchers when dealing with interdisciplinary literature, which may result in the use of studies that appear relevant on the surface but fail to provide adequate support.\nFor example, some LLM research cites psychology studies on the biological mechanisms of ToM to support discussions about ToM performance at the social level. \nThis conflates theoretical frameworks and research goals across different levels. \nThe activation of a specific brain region may indicate how a certain function is recruited, but it cannot directly show the individual's behavioral strategies or interaction styles in specific social contexts.\nSome researchers may use the superficial criterion of ``this article studied ToM'' to include it as supporting material, thereby masking logical leaps in their argumentation.\n\n\n\nIn addition, some LLM research selectively emphasizes positive findings while overlooking the limitations of the psychology research they cite.\nFor example, researchers may highlight only the conclusive statements from cited research, while ignoring important caveats noted by the original authors, such as experimental boundaries, sample limitations, or theoretical controversies. \nIn some cases, even papers that have been widely questioned (have controversial opinions) are cited without any clarification.\nThis kind of selective referencing can lead to a biased evidentiary base, thereby weakening the rigor of arguments.\nFor example, some papers refer to the two-systems account of ToM and observational studies on children\u2019s gaze behaviors to support the idea that LLMs may possess implicit ToM abilities, yet they fail to adequately address the ongoing debates and limitations within these studies. \nNotably, there is no scholarly consensus on whether children\u2019s gaze-shifting behavior truly indicates an implicit ToM.\nSome researchers suggest that such behaviors may stem from low-level attentional preferences rather than genuine mental state attribution. \nWe recommend that LLM researchers adopt a critical mindset when referencing psychology research, presenting the theoretical context, methodological constraints, and academic debates of the cited studies in a balanced way to ensure accuracy and scientific rigor in their arguments.\n\n\n\n\\item \\textbf{Secondary citation errors} \nAnother characteristic of how LLM research cites ToM papers is that researchers tend to rely more on secondary literature within the AI community when constructing ToM-related arguments, rather than directly consulting or citing primary literature from the field of psychology.\nIn other words, many theoretical claims or experimental justifications concerning ToM are based on interpretations by other LLM/NLP researchers rather than on direct engagement with original psychology research.\nThis phenomenon is not uncommon in scientific communication and within knowledge communities, and it is easy to understand why: researchers are more inclined to cite well-recognized work within their own field to enhance the acceptability and persuasiveness of their arguments during submission, peer review, or academic evaluation.\nThis ``in-group citation preference'' tends to create a closed citation loop. \nEarly studies that introduced ToM into the LLM context established a framework of terminology and tasks, and subsequent research continues to build upon this framework, gradually forming an internally-reinforced citation network.\n\n\n\nHowever, the cumulative bias inherent in secondary citations can further amplify the previously mentioned issues, such as conceptual overgeneralization, task confusion, narrow literature selection, and misinterpretation.\nIf one psychology research is misunderstood during its initial citation, subsequent literature that continues to cite this interpretation without verification can lead to a ``consensus of misreading.''\nMore critically, the nuanced descriptions, methodological complexities, and theoretical debates surrounding ToM in original psychology research are often compressed, oversimplified, or even omitted in secondary citations.\nFor example, some papers may not directly engage with the original studies by~\\citet{BARONCOHEN198537} on autism and ToM, but instead rely on brief summaries from other LLM research, which can risk overlooking essential elements such as experimental controls and sample differences.\nWe recommend that LLM researchers trace psychology theories or experiments back to their original sources, rather than relying solely on interpretative summaries from the NLP/LLM community. \nOnly by returning to the original citations can one clarify the theoretical context, research intent, and methodological limitations, thereby ensuring accuracy in understanding and rigor in application.\n\\end{itemize}\\begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt,left=8pt,itemsep=0pt]\n\\item \\textbf{Conceptual overgeneralization and misclassification}

arguments.\n\n\n\n\\item \\textbf{Secondary citation errors} \nAnother characteristic of how LLM research cites ToM papers is that researchers tend to rely more on secondary literature within the AI community when constructing ToM-related arguments, rather than directly consulting or citing primary literature from the field of psychology.\nIn other words, many theoretical claims or experimental justifications concerning ToM are based on interpretations by other LLM/NLP researchers rather than on direct engagement with original psychology research.\nThis phenomenon is not uncommon in scientific communication and within knowledge communities, and it is easy to understand why: researchers are more inclined to cite well-recognized work within their own field to enhance the acceptability and persuasiveness of their arguments during submission, peer review, or academic evaluation.\nThis ``in-group citation preference'' tends to create a closed citation loop. \nEarly studies that introduced ToM into the LLM context established a framework of terminology and tasks, and subsequent research continues to build upon this framework, gradually forming an internally-reinforced citation network.\n\n\n\nHowever, the cumulative bias inherent in secondary citations can further amplify the previously mentioned issues, such as conceptual overgeneralization, task confusion, narrow literature selection, and misinterpretation.\nIf one psychology research is misunderstood during its initial citation, subsequent literature that continues to cite this interpretation without verification can lead to a ``consensus of misreading.''\nMore critically, the nuanced descriptions, methodological complexities, and theoretical debates surrounding ToM in original psychology research are often compressed, oversimplified, or even omitted in secondary citations.\nFor example, some papers may not directly engage with the original studies by~\\citet{BARONCOHEN198537} on autism and ToM, but instead rely on brief summaries from other LLM research, which can risk overlooking essential elements such as experimental controls and sample differences.\nWe recommend that LLM researchers trace psychology theories or experiments back to their original sources, rather than relying solely on interpretative summaries from the NLP/LLM community. \nOnly by returning to the original citations can one clarify the theoretical context, research intent, and methodological limitations, thereby ensuring accuracy in understanding and rigor in application.\n\n\n\n", "appendix": false}, "Discussion": {"content": "\\label{sec:6}\n\n\n\\subsection{Summary of key findings}\\label{sec:6.1}\nHere, we summarize the answers to the three research questions posed at the end of \u00a7\\ref{sec:1}.\n\n\\textbf{RQ1}: How is psychology research integrated into LLM research?\n\n\\textbf{A1}: Since 2023, an increasing number of LLM research papers have cited psychology papers, indicating a growing interest among researchers in insights from psychology. \nSo far, psychology has been broadly integrated into LLM research, with \\textit{Neural Mechanisms} and \\textit{Psychometrics \\& JDM} being the most prominent psychology topics.\nLLM research topics demonstrate distinct referencing preferences for different areas of psychology. \nFor example, \\textit{Educational Application} and \\textit{Advanced Reasoning} clearly favor psychology papers from the \\textit{Education} and \\textit{Neural Mechanisms} clusters, respectively, whereas \\textit{Model Adaptation \\& Efficiency} and \\textit{Social Intelligence} draw on a much broader range of psychology topics.\nThese citation patterns result from the interplay between the nature of research topics in psychology and LLM research, as well as the characteristics of LLMs, such as being fast-updating, data-intensive, and black-box. More detailed discussions can be found in \u00a7\\ref{sec:5.1}.\n\n\\textbf{RQ2}: Which psychology theories/frameworks are most commonly used, and which remain\nunderexplored in LLM research?\n\n\\textbf{A2}: The top 10 psychology theories and frameworks most frequently cited by the surveyed LLM research papers are Dual-Process Theories (434 citations), Theory of Mind (309 citations), Heuristics and Biases Program (210 citations), Executive Functions (197 citations), Connectionism vs. Symbolism (190 citations), Theory-Theory (151 citations), Classical Test Theory (145 citations), Usage-based Models of Language (128 citations), Mental Simulation Theory (113 citations), and Schema Theory (109 citations).\nThe application of these theories and frameworks reveals that the LLM research paradigm is becoming increasingly pluralistic under the influence of psychology. \nThis paradigm begins as performance-driven and model-centric. As more psychology theories and frameworks are incorporated to guide experiments on LLMs, it gradually adopts a theory-driven and data-centric, i.e., empirical, approach.\nHowever, despite the many theories and frameworks within each psychology topic, as elaborated on in \u00a7\\ref{sec:5.2}, only some have been engaged by LLM research, leaving ample room for further exploration.\n\n\\textbf{RQ3}: How is psychology research operationalized and interpreted in the context of LLM research?\n\n\\textbf{A3}: A psychology theory/framework has multiple facets that can be studied from different perspectives in psychology research, leading to a variety of applications in LLM research that cite them. \nA case study on Theory of Mind is presented in \u00a7\\ref{sec:5.3} to exemplify this diversity.\nAcross the different methods of operationalization and interpretation, there are four types of common misapplications: \n1) \\textit{Conceptual Overgeneralization and Misclassification}, where LLM researchers cite related psychology research clarifying its primary design, target population, or key conclusions; \n2) \\textit{Partial or Incomplete Citation}, where LLM researchers rely on a few popular papers about their intended psychology theories and frameworks, overlooking other, potentially more relevant, but less well-known research;\n3) \\textit{Misinterpretation or Misrepresentation of Findings}, where LLM researchers cite inappropriate psychology papers to support their arguments or overly emphasize partial findings from the cited papers, despite only topical relevance; and\n4) \\textit{Secondary Citation Errors}, where LLM researchers prefer citing influential LLM research papers that engage with the intended psychology theories and frameworks over the original psychology research itself.\nAll these misuses, while they may lead to surprising findings, could compromise the validity and accuracy of insights drawn from psychology.\n\n\\subsection{Theoretical and methodological reflections}\\label{sec:6.2}\n\nAlthough the intersection of AI research and psychology is advancing rapidly, productive interdisciplinary integration continues to face theoretical and methodological challenges.\n\n\n\nFirst, on the theoretical level, current AI research often tends to instrumentalize psychology theories, simplifying complex ideas into quantifiable conceptual labels.\nAlthough this simplification lowers the threshold for applying theories, it can also obscure the deeper structures of the original frameworks.\nFor example, the use of ToM in AI research often treats mental states like beliefs and desires as static data points.\nIn contrast, within psychology research, ToM is understood as a dynamic, context-dependent ability, typically characterized by uncertainty, ambiguity, and developmental variability.\nBehind this simplification lies a fundamental difference between the goals of psychology theories and the goals of AI researchers when applying these theories. \nPsychology aims to explain the internal mechanisms of human behavior and mental activity, emphasizing the complexity of processes and the importance of social and cultural contexts.\nIn contrast, AI researchers tend to focus more on functional reconstruction and engineering implementation, often transforming psychology concepts into operational and computable model parameters.\nThe risk of such oversimplification in AI can lead to misleading conclusions about the capabilities of AI systems, such as overestimating their understanding of human behavior or wrongly attributing human-like intentionality to models that merely simulate behavioral patterns. \nBy failing to account for the fluid, interpretive nature of social reasoning, AI models risk reinforcing shallow imitations of human cognition, which may perform well in isolated tasks but lack the flexibility and depth needed for genuinely adaptive or ethical interaction.\nTo avoid conceptual drift, AI researchers referencing psychology theories should pay close attention to their original context, like core assumptions and theoretical boundaries, rather than merely adopting surface-level terminology.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, psychology theories are often used as tools to explain model behavior, but such post hoc explanations often lack predictive power and systematic structure. \nOne example is to use attention in cognitive psychology to explain the behavior of neural models like Transformers.\nThis explanation is derived after observing the model\u2019s output and does not offer predictive insight into how the model will behave in unseen scenarios.\nThe psychology concept of attention involves complex processes, whereas the attention mechanism in models is a deterministic computation of similarity scores.\nWithout a rigorous mapping between theoretical constructs and model components, these psychology references risk becoming superficial narratives\u2014appealing and intuitive, but ultimately can not guide future model development or evaluation.\nInterdisciplinary research should place greater emphasis on theoretical modeling in the early stages, encouraging the integration of clear psychological hypotheses during the experimental design phase, rather than retrofitting existing theories only at the analysis stage.\n\n\n\nAt the methodological level, the operationalization of psychological concepts in AI research also faces challenges.\nMany studies attempt to simulate psychological phenomena by constructing proxy tasks; however, these tasks are often unvalidated and lack construct validity.\nWe argue that AI research should draw on psychology's strong emphasis on measurement validity and experimental control by incorporating more systematic psychological methods into task design and data interpretation. \nFor example, collaborating with psychologists to design experiments, using standardized scales, and reporting the psychological validity of tasks are all feasible strategies for improving methodological quality.\n\n\n\nIt is worth noting that the field of HCI has long been a prime example of interdisciplinary research.\nThis field not only values theory-driven research design but also emphasizes methodological diversity and rigor.\nDrawing from multiple disciplines, HCI has successfully embedded different knowledge into multiple stages of the research process, such as problem definition, system design, user modeling, and evaluation. \nThis systematic approach offers valuable insights for AI research.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Toward more responsible interdisciplinary practice}\\label{sec:6.3}\n\nTo build a stronger and more sustainable bridge between AI and psychology research, we advocate for more responsible interdisciplinary practices.\nThis is not just about upholding ethical standards; it is also about ensuring scientific rigor.\nWith that in mind, we offer a few recommendations aimed at promoting clearer standards, more consistent methods, and deeper collaboration across disciplines.\n\n\\paragraph{Theoretical accountability.}Theoretical accountability.\n\nWhen drawing on psychology theories, researchers should clearly explain where these theories come from, what assumptions they rest on, and how far they can reasonably be applied to avoid misinterpretation or conceptual reconstruction.\nFurthermore, competing theoretical perspectives should be adequately addressed, with explicit justification for the chosen framework and acknowledgment of its limitations.\nSuch theoretical accountability not only strengthens research transparency but also provides a thoughtful re-evaluation of the extent to which psychology theories can be meaningfully applied in AI research.\n\n\\paragraph{Construct operationalization.}Construct operationalization.\n\nInterdisciplinary research works best when there is a clear and defensible connection between psychological concepts and the technical tasks. \nWe suggest starting with standardized, widely accepted measurement tools from psychology whenever possible. \nIf you need to design custom tasks, it is important to clearly explain how those tasks reflect the underlying psychological construct and to back that explanation with theory. \nWhen appropriate, multiple forms of measurement (e.g., behavioral data, linguistic outputs, and subjective ratings) should be employed to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of the construct.\n\n\n\\paragraph{Collaborative parity.}Collaborative parity.\n\nInterdisciplinary collaboration should not be about one field just doing what another wants. \nInstead, it really needs to be built on a foundation of mutual respect, where different disciplines are truly co-creating something new.\nTo make this happen, we think it is important to encourage things like joint authorship across disciplines, working together from the very beginning to formulate research questions, and making sure we weave in a variety of analytical perspectives.\n\n\n\\paragraph{Open interdisciplinary infrastructure.}Open interdisciplinary infrastructure.\n\nWe advocate for the development of open knowledge infrastructures that support interdisciplinary collaboration. \nExamples include reusable datasets on psychology constructs and measurement methods, case templates for interdisciplinary research, and cross-referencing maps. \nSuch resources would lower the barriers to collaboration, enhance the quality of research, and foster the accumulation and transmission of knowledge across disciplinary communities.\n\nIn sum, responsible interdisciplinary practice is not a matter of occasional collaboration, but rather a sustainable and institutionalized research framework. \nBy strengthening theoretical accountability, standardizing how we use constructs, and promoting equitable collaboration and shared infrastructure, we can achieve a deeper, more trusting integration of AI and psychology research.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Limitations and future directions}\\label{sec:6.4}\n\nAlthough we aim to provide a thorough survey of how psychology research is cited and integrated in AI research, several limitations should be acknowledged, as they may affect the broader applicability and interpretive depth of our findings.\n\n\n\nFirst, in terms of the time range, our analysis focuses on published CS research between December 2022 and March 2025, primarily reflecting the short-term impact and initial integration of psychology research into LLM research.\nGiven that interdisciplinary influences often exhibit a time lag, the deeper transformation of psychology theories, methodological integration, and practical impact may still be in the early stages.\nAs a result, our findings may underestimate the long-term knowledge diffusion and paradigm-shifting role of psychology in LLM research.\n\n\nSecondly, in terms of the analyzed data, we primarily examined English-based papers from top AI conferences, which may have led to the omission of relevant work from other important fields. \nAdditionally, differences in database indexing mechanisms and citation formats may have caused some psychology sources to be overlooked, potentially resulting in a possible underrepresentation of psychology sources.\n\n\n\nPurely exploring the integration of AI research and psychology research from the citation-based perspective might be a limitation.\nFuture studies could extend this work by moving beyond citation-based analyses to explore the actual processes of interdisciplinary collaboration between AI and psychology. \nThis may include examining how knowledge is negotiated across disciplinary boundaries, how research teams are structured, and which collaboration mechanisms are most effective. \nSuch qualitative insights would complement the current study\u2019s bibliometric approach and provide a more comprehensive understanding of how these fields interact in practice.\n\n", "appendix": false}, "Conclusion": {"content": "\\label{sec:7}\n\nThis

arises, and how better practices can be cultivated. \nAs AI systems become increasingly embedded in the fabric of society, the importance of methodological pluralism, conceptual clarity, and cross-disciplinary rigor will only grow.\nPsychology has helped us understand human intelligence; with care and collaboration, it may also help us build AI more
