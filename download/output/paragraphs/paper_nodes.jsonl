In this work, we propose , a multi-agent framework for research community simulation. Within this framework, the human research community is simplified as an , where researchers and papers are represented as agent-type and data-type nodes, respectively, and connected based on their collaboration relationships. We also introduce , a text-based inference framework that models various research activities (, paper reading, paper writing, and review writing) as special forms of a unified message-passing process on the agent-data graph. To evaluate the quality of the research community simulation, we present , a benchmark that uses a node-masking prediction task for scalable and objective assessment based on similarity. Our experiments reveal three key findings: (1)  can provide a realistic simulation of collaborative research activities, including paper writing and review writing; (2)  can maintain robust simulation with multiple researchers and diverse papers; (3)  can generate interdisciplinary research ideas that potentially inspire pioneering research directions.", "title": "ResearchTown: Simulator of Human Research Community", "type": "paperNode"}
