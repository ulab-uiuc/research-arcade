However,\\nincorporating both graph structure and feature information leads to complex\\nmodels, and explaining predictions made by GNNs remains unsolved. Here we\\npropose GNNExplainer, the first general, model-agnostic approach for providing\\ninterpretable explanations for predictions of any GNN-based model on any\\ngraph-based machine learning task. Given an instance, GNNExplainer identifies a\\ncompact subgraph structure and a small subset of node features that have a\\ncrucial role in GNN's prediction. Further, GNNExplainer can generate consistent\\nand concise explanations for an entire class of instances. We formulate\\nGNNExplainer as an optimization task that maximizes the mutual information\\nbetween a GNN's prediction and distribution of possible subgraph structures.\\nExperiments on synthetic and real-world graphs show that our approach can\\nidentify important graph structures as well as node features, and outperforms\\nbaselines by 17.1% on average. GNNExplainer provides a variety of benefits,\\nfrom the ability to visualize semantically relevant structures to\\ninterpretability, to giving insights into errors of faulty GNNs.\", 'authors': ['Rex Ying', 'Dylan Bourgeois', 'Jiaxuan You', 'Marinka Zitnik', 'Jure Leskovec'], 'published': '2019-03-10 00:56:26+00:00', 'categories': ['cs.LG', 'stat.ML'], 'url': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03894v4'}\n",
      "{'id': '1806.08804v4', 'title': 'Hierarchical Graph Representation Learning with Differentiable Pooling', 'abstract': 'Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have revolutionized the field of graph\\nrepresentation learning through effectively learned node embeddings, and\\nachieved state-of-the-art results in tasks such as node classification and link\\nprediction. However, current GNN methods are inherently flat and do not learn\\nhierarchical representations of graphs---a limitation that is especially\\nproblematic for the task of graph classification, where the goal is to predict\\nthe label associated with an entire graph. Here we propose DiffPool, a\\ndifferentiable graph pooling module that can generate hierarchical\\nrepresentations of graphs and can be combined with various graph neural network\\narchitectures in an end-to-end fashion. DiffPool learns a differentiable soft\\ncluster assignment for nodes at each layer of a deep GNN, mapping nodes to a\\nset of clusters, which then form the coarsened input for the next GNN layer.\\nOur experimental results show that combining existing GNN methods with DiffPool\\nyields an average improvement of 5-10% accuracy on graph classification\\nbenchmarks, compared to all existing pooling approaches, achieving a new\\nstate-of-the-art on four out of five benchmark data sets.', 'authors': ['Rex Ying', 'Jiaxuan You', 'Christopher Morris', 'Xiang Ren', 'William L.

      "Total sections: [(1, \"\\n\\\\label{sec:intro}\\nIn recent years there has been a surge of interest in developing graph neural networks (GNNs)---general deep learning architectures that can operate over graph structured data, such as social network data \\\\cite{hamilton2017inductive,kipf2017semi,Vel+2018} or graph-based representations of molecules \\\\cite{dai2016discriminative,Duv+2015,Gil+2017}.\\nThe general approach with GNNs is to view the underlying graph as a computation graph and learn neural network primitives that generate individual node embeddings by passing, transforming, and aggregating node feature information across the graph~\\\\cite{Gil+2017,hamilton2017inductive}.\\nThe generated node embeddings can then be used as input to any differentiable prediction layer, e.g., for node classification \\\\cite{hamilton2017inductive} or link prediction \\\\cite{Sch+2017}, and the whole model can be trained in an end-to-end fashion. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, a major limitation of current GNN architectures is that they are inherently {\\\\em flat}\\\\em flat as they only propagate information across the edges of the graph and are unable to infer and aggregate the information in a \\\\textit{hierarchical} way. \\nFor example, in order to successfully encode the graph structure of organic molecules, one would ideally want to encode the local molecular structure (e.g., individual atoms and their direct bonds) as well as the coarse-grained structure of the molecular graph (e.g., groups of atoms and bonds representing functional units in a molecule).\\nThis lack of hierarchical structure is especially problematic for the task of graph classification, where the goal is to predict the label associated with an \\\\textit{entire graph}. When applying GNNs to graph classification, the standard approach is to generate embeddings for all the nodes in the graph and then to {\\\\em globally pool}\\\\em globally pool all these node embeddings together, e.g., using a simple summation or neural network that operates over sets \\\\cite{dai2016discriminative,Duv+2015,Gil+2017,Li+2016}. This global pooling approach ignores any hierarchical structure that might be present in the graph, and it prevents researchers from building effective GNN models for predictive tasks over entire graphs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere we propose \\\\name, a differentiable graph pooling module that can be adapted to various graph neural network architectures in an hierarchical and end-to-end fashion (Figure~\\\\ref{fig:illustration}). \\n\\\\name allows for developing deeper GNN models that can learn to operate on hierarchical representations of a graph. We develop a graph analogue of the spatial pooling operation in CNNs \\\\cite{krizhevsky2012imagenet}, which allows for deep CNN architectures to iteratively operate on coarser and coarser representations of an image. The challenge in the GNN setting---compared to standard CNNs---is that graphs contain no natural notion of spatial locality, i.e., one cannot simply pool together all nodes in a ``$m \\\\times m$m \\\\times m patch'' on a graph, because the complex topological structure of graphs precludes any straightforward, deterministic definition of a ``patch''. Moreover, unlike image data, graph data sets often contain graphs with varying numbers of nodes and edges, which makes defining a general graph pooling operator even more challenging.\\n\\nIn order to solve the above challenges, we require a model that learns how to cluster together nodes to build a hierarchical multi-layer scaffold on top of the underlying graph. \\nOur approach \\\\name learns a differentiable soft assignment at each layer of a deep GNN, mapping nodes to a set of clusters based on their learned embeddings. \\nIn this framework, we generate deep GNNs by ``stacking'' GNN layers in a hierarchical fashion (Figure~\\\\ref{fig:illustration}): the input nodes at the layer $l$l GNN module correspond to the clusters learned at the layer $l-1$l-1 GNN module. \\nThus, each layer of \\\\name coarsens the input graph more and more, and \\\\name is able to generate a hierarchical representation of any input graph after training.\\nWe show that \\\\name\\\\ can be combined with various GNN approaches, resulting in an average 7\\\\% gain in accuracy and a new state of the art on four out of five benchmark graph classification tasks. \\nFinally,  we show that \\\\name\\\\ can learn interpretable hierarchical clusters that correspond to well-defined communities in the input graphs.\\n\\\\cut{\\n\\\\jure{Say much much more about our method, how it works and why it is cool.}\\n\\n\\\\chris{Maybe add highlevel visualization of the idea.}\\n\\n\\\\jure{ I strongly agree, we need a Figure 1 with an illustration of the method.\\nFor example, a graph and then a hierarchical multi-layer scaffold on top of it.\\nWill, you are great at creating good figures.

has $d$d features.\\\\footnote{We do not consider edge features, although one can easily extend the algorithm to support edge features using techniques introduced in \\\\cite{simonovsky2017dynamic}.}\\nGiven a set of labeled graphs $\\\\mathcal{D}=\\\\{(G_1,y_1),(G_2,y_2),...\\\\}$\\\\mathcal{D}=\\\\{(G_1,y_1),(G_2,y_2),...\\\\} where $y_i \\\\in

\\\\mathcal{G} \\\\to \\\\mathcal{Y}$f : \\\\mathcal{G} \\\\to \\\\mathcal{Y} that maps graphs to the set of labels. \\nThe challenge---compared to standard supervised machine learning setup---is that we need a way to extract useful feature vectors from these input graphs.\\nThat is, in order to apply standard machine learning methods for classification, e.g., neural networks, we need a procedure to convert each graph to an finite dimensional vector in $\\\\mathbb{R}^D$\\\\mathbb{R}^D.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\\xhdr{Graph neural networks}Graph neural networks\\nIn this work, we build upon graph neural networks in order to learn useful representations for graph classification in an end-to-end fashion. \\nIn particular, we consider GNNs that employ the following general ``message-passing'' architecture:\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\\\label{eq:gnn}\\n     H^{(k)} = M(A,H^{(k-1)};\\\\theta^{(k)}),\\n\\\\end{equation}\\\\begin{equation}\\\\label{eq:gnn}\\n     H^{(k)} =

\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n \\\\times d}n \\\\times d are the node embeddings (i.e., ``messages'') computed after $k$k steps of the GNN and $M$M is the message propagation function, which depends on the adjacency matrix, trainable parameters $\\\\theta^{(k)}$\\\\theta^{(k)}(k), and the node embeddings $H^{(k-1)}$H^{(k-1)}(k-1) generated from the previous message-passing step.\\\\footnote{For notational convenience, we assume that the embedding dimension is $d$ for all $H^{(k)}$; however, in general this restriction is not necessary.}\\nThe input node embeddings $H^{(0)}$H^{(0)}(0) at the initial message-passing iteration $(k=1)$(k=1), are initialized using\\nthe node features on the graph, $H^{(0)} = F$H^{(0)}(0) = F. \\n\\nThere are many possible implementations of the propagation function $M$M \\\\cite{Gil+2017,hamilton2017inductive}.\\nFor example, one popular variant of GNNs---Kipf's \\\\etal \\\\cite{kipf2017semi} Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)---implements $M$M using a combination of linear transformations and ReLU non-linearities:\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n    \\\\label{eq:gcn}\\n    H^{(k)} =  M(A,H^{(k-1)};W^{(k)}) =

adjacency matrix $A$A and initial input node features $X$X. \\n\\n\\\\xhdr{Stacking GNNs and pooling layers}Stacking GNNs and pooling layers\\nGNNs implementing Equation \\\\eqref{eq:gnn} are inherently flat, as they only propagate information across edges of a graph.\\nThe goal of this work is to define a general, end-to-end differentiable strategy that allows one to {\\\\em stack}\\\\em stack multiple GNN modules in a hierarchical fashion. \\nFormally, given $Z = \\\\gnn(A, X)$Z = \\\\gnn(A, X), the output of a GNN module, and a graph adjacency matrix $A \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n \\\\times n}$A \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n \\\\times n}n \\\\times n, we seek to define a strategy to output a new coarsened graph containing $m<n$m<n nodes, with weighted adjacency matrix $A^{'} \\\\in

coarsened graph can then be used as input to another GNN layer, and this whole process can be repeated $L$L times, generating a model with $L$L GNN layers that operate on a series of coarser and coarser versions of the input graph (Figure~\\\\ref{fig:illustration}).\\nThus, our goal is to learn how to cluster or pool together nodes using the output of a GNN, so that we can use this coarsened graph as input to another GNN layer.\\nWhat makes designing such a pooling layer for GNNs especially challenging---compared to the usual graph coarsening task---is that our goal is not to simply cluster the nodes in one graph, but to provide a general recipe to hierarchically pool nodes across a broad set of input graphs. \\nThat is, we need our model to learn a pooling strategy that will generalize across graphs with different nodes, edges, and that can adapt to the various graph structures during inference. \\n\\n\\\\cut{\\n\\\\chris{I think the paragraph below repeats some of the

stack filters with increasingly large receptive fields, the pooling layers in a GNN should be stacked hierarchically, extracting coarser and coarser subgraph structures to allow the GNN to obtain a more global view of the graph at the final layers. \\n%Firstly, the pooling layer should respect the hierarchical structure of graph.\\n%In the context of ConvNets for images, a deep neural network is only effective if the architecture allows a larger and larger receptive field.\\n%Similarly, it is desirable to have graph pooling layers to be stacked hierarchically, extracting larger subgraph structures and allow GNN to obtain a more global view at higher level.\\n%At the same time, the pooling layer should retain the structural information of the graph.\\n%Intuitively, each pooling results in a more coarsened graph representation, where another layer of graph convolution can be applied.\\n%There are several key ingredients for an effective pooling strategy. \\n%Thus, in terms of graph structure, the pooling layer should effectively partition the graph into modular components . \\n%As a result, a good pooling strategy should generally comply with the property of homophily on graphs,\\n%\\\\emph{i.e.} the idea that nodes that are close to each other in graph should be pooled.\\nMoreover, what makes designing a pooling layer for GNNs especially challenging---compared to the

following this, we discuss how we generate the assignment matrix using a GNN architecture. \\n\\n\\\\xhdr{Pooling with an assignment matrix}Pooling with an assignment matrix\\nWe denote the learned cluster assignment matrix at layer $l$l as $S^{(l)} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n_l \\\\times n_{l+1}}$S^{(l)}(l) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n_l \\\\times n_{l+1}}n_l \\\\times n_{l+1}l+1. \\nEach row of $S^{(l)}$S^{(l)}(l) corresponds to one of the $n_l$n_l nodes (or clusters) at layer $l$l, and each column of $S^{(l)}$S^{(l)}(l) corresponds to one of the $n_{l+1}$n_{l+1}l+1 clusters at the next layer $l+1$l+1. \\nIntuitively, $S^{(l)}$S^{(l)}(l) provides a soft assignment of each node at layer $l$l to a cluster in the next coarsened layer $l+1$l+1.\\n\\nSuppose that $S^{(l)}$S^{(l)}(l) has already been computed, i.e., that we have computed the assignment matrix at the $l$l-th layer of our model.\\nWe denote the input adjacency matrix at this layer as $A^{(l)}$A^{(l)}(l) and denote the input node embedding matrix at this layer as $Z^{(l)}$Z^{(l)}(l).\\nGiven these inputs, the \\\\name layer $(A^{(l+1)},X^{(l+1)}) = \\\\textsc{DiffPool}(A^{(l)},Z^{(l)})$(A^{(l+1)}(l+1),X^{(l+1)}(l+1)) = \\\\textsc{DiffPool}(A^{(l)}(l),Z^{(l)}(l)) coarsens the input graph, generating a new coarsened adjacency matrix $A^{(l+1)}$A^{(l+1)}(l+1) and a new matrix of embeddings $X^{(l+1)}$X^{(l+1)}(l+1) for each of the nodes/clusters in this coarsened graph.\\nIn particular, we apply the two following equations:\\n\\\\begin{align}\\n\\\\label{eq:4}\\n&X^{(l+1)} = {S^{(l)}}^T Z^{(l)}\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n_{l+1} \\\\times d},\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\label{eq:5}\\n&A^{(l+1)} = {S^{(l)}}^T A^{(l)}{S^{(l)}} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n_{l+1} \\\\times n_{l+1}}.\\n\\\\end{align}\\\\begin{align}\\n\\\\label{eq:4}\\n&X^{(l+1)} = {S^{(l)}}^T Z^{(l)}\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n_{l+1} \\\\times d},\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\label{eq:5}\\n&A^{(l+1)} = {S^{(l)}}^T A^{(l)}{S^{(l)}} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n_{l+1} \\\\times n_{l+1}}.\\n\\\\end{align}\\n\\\\label{eq:4}\\n&X^{(l+1)}(l+1) = {S^{(l)}}S^{(l)}(l)^T Z^{(l)}(l)\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n_{l+1} \\\\times d}n_{l+1}l+1 \\\\times d,\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\label{eq:5}\\n&A^{(l+1)}(l+1) = {S^{(l)}}S^{(l)}(l)^T A^{(l)}(l){S^{(l)}}S^{(l)}(l) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n_{l+1} \\\\times n_{l+1}}n_{l+1}l+1 \\\\times n_{l+1}l+1.\\n\\nEquation \\\\eqref{eq:4} takes the node embeddings $Z^{(l)}$Z^{(l)}(l) and aggregates these embeddings according to the cluster assignments $S^{(l)}$S^{(l)}(l), generating embeddings for each of the $n_{l+1}$n_{l+1}l+1 clusters.\\nSimilarly, Equation \\\\eqref{eq:5} takes the adjacency matrix $A^{(l)}$A^{(l)}(l) and generates a coarsened adjacency matrix denoting the connectivity strength between each pair of clusters. \\n\\nThrough Equations \\\\eqref{eq:4} and \\\\eqref{eq:5}, the \\\\name layer coarsens the graph: the next layer adjacency matrix $A^{(l+1)}$A^{(l+1)}(l+1) represents a coarsened graph with $n_{l+1}$n_{l+1}l+1 nodes or {\\\\em cluster nodes}\\\\em cluster nodes, where each individual cluster node in the new coarsened graph corresponds to a cluster of nodes in the graph at layer $l$l.\\nNote that $A^{(l+1)}$A^{(l+1)}(l+1) is a real matrix and represents a fully connected edge-weighted  graph; each entry $A^{(l+1)}_{ij}$A^{(l+1)}(l+1)_{ij}ij can be viewed as the connectivity strength between cluster $i$i and cluster $j$j. \\nSimilarly, the $i$i-th row of $X^{(l+1)}$X^{(l+1)}(l+1) corresponds to the embedding of cluster $i$i. \\nTogether, the coarsened adjacency matrix $A^{(l+1)}$A^{(l+1)}(l+1) and cluster embeddings $X^{(l+1)}$X^{(l+1)}(l+1) can be used as input to another GNN layer, a process which we describe in detail below.  \\n\\n\\n\\\\xhdr{Learning the assignment matrix}Learning the assignment matrix\\nIn the following we describe the architecture of \\\\name, i.e., how \\\\name\\\\ generates the assignment matrix $S^{(l)}$S^{(l)}(l) and embedding matrices $Z^{(l)}$Z^{(l)}(l) that are used in Equations \\\\eqref{eq:4} and \\\\eqref{eq:5}.\\nWe generate these two matrices using two separate GNNs that are both applied to the input cluster node features $X^{(l)}$X^{(l)}(l) and coarsened adjacency matrix $A^{(l)}$A^{(l)}(l).\\nThe {\\\\em embedding GNN}\\\\em embedding GNN at layer $l$l is a standard GNN module applied to these inputs:\\n\\\\begin{align}\\\\label{eq:embedgnn}\\n   Z^{(l)} = \\\\gnn_{l, \\\\textrm{embed}}(A^{(l)}, X^{(l)}),\\n\\\\end{align}\\\\begin{align}\\\\label{eq:embedgnn}\\n   Z^{(l)} = \\\\gnn_{l, \\\\textrm{embed}}(A^{(l)}, X^{(l)}),\\n\\\\end{align}\\\\label{eq:embedgnn}\\n   Z^{(l)}(l) = \\\\gnn_{l, \\\\textrm{embed}}l, \\\\textrm{embed}(A^{(l)}(l), X^{(l)}(l)),\\n\\ni.e., we take the adjacency matrix between the cluster nodes at layer $l$l (from Equation \\\\ref{eq:5}) and the pooled features for the clusters (from Equation \\\\ref{eq:4}) and pass these matrices through a standard GNN to get new embeddings $Z^{(l)}$Z^{(l)}(l) for the cluster nodes. \\nIn contrast, the {\\\\em pooling GNN}\\\\em pooling GNN at layer $l$l, uses the input cluster features $X^{(l)}$X^{(l)}(l) and cluster adjacency matrix $A^{(l)}$A^{(l)}(l) to generate an assignment matrix:\\n\\\\begin{align}\\\\label{eq:poolgnn}\\n    S^{(l)} = \\\\textrm{softmax}\\\\left(\\\\gnn_{l,\\\\text{pool}}(A^{(l)}, X^{(l)})\\\\right),\\n\\\\end{align}\\\\begin{align}\\\\label{eq:poolgnn}\\n    S^{(l)} = \\\\textrm{softmax}\\\\left(\\\\gnn_{l,\\\\text{pool}}(A^{(l)}, X^{(l)})\\\\right),\\n\\\\end{align}\\\\label{eq:poolgnn}\\n    S^{(l)}(l) = \\\\textrm{softmax}\\\\left(\\\\gnn_{l,\\\\text{pool}}l,\\\\text{pool}(A^{(l)}(l), X^{(l)}(l))\\\\right),\\n\\nwhere the softmax function is applied in a row-wise fashion.\\nThe output dimension of $\\\\gnn_{l,\\\\text{pool}}$\\\\gnn_{l,\\\\text{pool}}l,\\\\text{pool} corresponds to a pre-defined maximum number of clusters in layer $l$l, and is a hyperparameter of the model.\\n\\nNote that these two GNNs consume the same input data but have distinct parameterizations and play separate roles:\\nThe embedding GNN generates new embeddings for the input nodes at this layer, while the pooling GNN generates a probabilistic assignment of the input nodes to $n_{l+1}$n_{l+1}l+1 clusters.\\n\\nIn the base case, the inputs to Equations \\\\eqref{eq:embedgnn} and Equations \\\\eqref{eq:poolgnn} at layer $l=0$l=0 are simply the input adjacency matrix $A$A and the node features $F$F for the original graph.\\nAt the penultimate layer $L-1$L-1 of a deep GNN model using \\\\name, we set the assignment matrix $S^{(L-1)}$S^{(L-1)}(L-1) be a vector of $1$1's, i.e., all nodes at the final layer $L$L are assigned to a single cluster, generating a final embedding vector corresponding to the entire graph.\\nThis final output embedding can then be used as feature input to a differentiable classifier (e.g., a softmax layer), and the entire system can be trained end-to-end using stochastic gradient descent. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\\xhdr{Permutation invariance}Permutation invariance\\nNote that in order to be useful for graph classification, the pooling layer should be invariant under node permutations.

Therefore, at deeper layers, the output dimension of $g_\\\\phi$g_\\\\phi decreases exponentially. Here the dimension reduction ratio $\\\\alpha$\\\\alpha is a hyper-parameter. In practice, we discover that performance is insensitive for $0.1 < \\\\alpha < 0.5$0.1 < \\\\alpha < 0.5. The network outputs a sparse $S$S if the number of intuitive clusters are much less than the output dimension.\\n\\n\\\\xhdr{Auxiliary objectives}Auxiliary objectives\\nControlling input features and representation dimension is still insufficient for $g_\\\\phi$g_\\\\phi to learn and extract meaningful cluster information from a graph. We additionally supply side objectives as regularizations for $g_\\\\phi$g_\\\\phi. \\nIntuitively, $g_\\\\phi$g_\\\\phi should learn to assign nodes that are close together in terms of connectivity into the same clusters. \\nHence, we use a link prediction objective to further encourage similarity of cluster assignments.\\nParticularly, at each layer $l$l, we minimize\\n$L_{\\\\text{LP}} ||A^{(l)}, S^{(l)} S^{{(l)}^T}||_F$L_{\\\\text{LP}}\\\\text{LP} ||A^{(l)}(l), S^{(l)}(l) S^{{(l)}^T}{(l)}(l)^T||_F, where $||\\\\cdot||_F$||\\\\cdot||_F denotes the Frobinus norm. \\nNote that the (soft) adjacency matrix $A^{(l)}$A^{(l)}(l) at deeper layers is a function of lower level assignment matrices, and changes during training. \\n\\nAnother important characteristic of $g_\\\\phi$g_\\\\phi is that the output cluster assignment for each node should generally be close to a one-hot vector, so that the membership for each cluster or subgraph is clearly defined, except in rare cases where a node serves as a bridge between multiple clusters. We therefore regularize the entropy of the cluster assignment by minimizing $L_{\\\\text{E}} = \\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\sum_{i=1}^n H(S_i)$L_{\\\\text{E}}\\\\text{E} = \\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\sum_{i=1}i=1^n H(S_i), where $H$H denotes the entropy function, and $S_i$S_i is the $i$i-th row of $S$S.\\n\\nDuring training, $L_{\\\\text{LP}}$L_{\\\\text{LP}}\\\\text{LP} and $L_{\\\\text{E}}$L_{\\\\text{E}}\\\\text{E} from each layer are added to the classification loss, in order to obtain meaningful assignment matrices at all layers. In practice we observe that training with the side objective takes longer to converge, but nevertheless achieves better performance and more interpretable cluster assignment.\\n\\n\\\\note{Note to Rex himself: try curriculum training}Note to Rex himself: try curriculum training\\n\\\\chris{Where is $g_\\\\phi$ and $f_\\\\theta$ defined}Where is $g_\\\\phi$g_\\\\phi and $f_\\\\theta$f_\\\\theta defined\\n\\n\\\\xhdr{Relation to low rank matrix factorization}Relation to low rank matrix factorization\\nWe note that by approximating $A$A with $S S^T$S S^T, the link prediction auxiliary objective bears close resemblance to a low rank matrix factorization of $A$A, and well-separated pair decomposition (WSPD). \\nSimilar to matrix factorization, we require that at each layer, $S$S is able to capture most of the distance information between nodes, while using less dimensions than that of $A$A. However, low rank matrix factorization is non-convex and has many local minimums. When trained end-to-end in the graph classification task, \\\\name tends to find local minimum that is better suited for the task. This explains our observation that DiffPool consistently out-performs a two-step procedure of graph clustering followed by GCN that pools over these clusters.\\n$\\\\mathrm{WSPD}$\\\\mathrm{WSPD} computes small number of pairs of clusters, such that for any pair of points $(p, q)$(p, q), we can find a pair of clusters $(A, B)$(A, B) such that $p\\\\in A, q\\\\in B$p\\\\in A, q\\\\in B, and $d(p, q) \\\\approx d(A, B)$d(p, q) \\\\approx d(A, B). In the case of \\\\name, the goal of the auxiliary objective is to let the connectivity strength between any node pair $(p, q)$(p, q) to be reflected by the connectivity strength between their corresponding clusters. However, unlike WSPD, the assignment in \\\\name is soft to allow differentiability, which enables end-to-end training and avoids the high computation cost of WSPD in high dimensions.\\n\\n\\n\\\\xhdr{Behavior on sparse and dense networks}Behavior on sparse and dense networks\\nThe sparsity of graphs also affects the behavior of the assignment network $g_\\\\phi$g_\\\\phi.\\nSuppose a subgraph of the input graph is dense, therefore the entries of the corresponding subgraph adjacency matrix are mostly ones. Since  $\\\\mathbf{1} \\\\mathbf{1}^T$\\\\mathbf{1} \\\\mathbf{1}^T is a matrix of all ones, an assignment matrix for the subgraph, where one column is a vector of ones and the others are zero vectors, will be close to a minimum of the link prediction auxiliary objective. Hence the objective will tend to group all nodes into one cluster. \\\\chris{We could also formalize it and prove it.}We could also formalize it and prove it.This  implies that all nodes in the dense subgraph are clustered into a single hyper-node. In contrast, when a subgraph is sparse, the resulting assignment tends to have higher entropy, and nodes could be assigned to different clusters, so that the elements of $S S^T$S S^T are small.\\n\\nThis interpretation matches our pooling objective well. Intuitively, a clique-like subgraph contains very little interesting structure, and message passing is efficient due to small graph diameter, and hence it could be directly pooled together without losing much structural information in the pooled embedding matrix. However, a sparse subgraph may contain many interesting structures, including path-, cycle- and tree-like ones. Therefore, message passing may miss these fine-grained structures. Subsequently, each part of the subgraph should be assigned and pooled differently, to capture these meaningful structures. \\n\\n\\n\\n\", 'Proposed Method', False, '1806.08804v4'), (4, \"\\n\\\\label{sec:ex}\\n\\nWe evaluate the benefits of \\\\name\\\\ against a number of state-of-the-art graph classification approaches, with the goal of answering the following questions:\\n\\\\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=20pt]\\n\\\\item[{\\\\bf Q1}] How does  \\\\name\\\\ compare to other pooling methods proposed for GNNs (e.g., using sort pooling~\\\\cite{zhang2018end} or the \\\\textsc{Set2Set} method \\\\cite{Gil+2017})?\\n\\\\item[{\\\\bf Q2}] How does  \\\\name\\\\ combined with GNNs compare to the state-of-the-art for graph classification task, including both GNNs and kernel-based methods?\\n\\\\item[{\\\\bf Q3}] Does  \\\\name  compute meaningful and interpretable clusters on the input graphs?\\n\\\\end{enumerate}\\\\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=20pt]\\n\\\\item[{\\\\bf Q1}] How does  \\\\name\\\\ compare to other pooling methods proposed for GNNs (e.g., using sort pooling~\\\\cite{zhang2018end} or the \\\\textsc{Set2Set} method \\\\cite{Gil+2017})?\\n\\\\item[{\\\\bf Q2}] How does  \\\\name\\\\ combined with GNNs compare to the state-of-the-art for graph classification task, including both GNNs and kernel-based methods?\\n\\\\item[{\\\\bf Q3}] Does  \\\\name  compute meaningful and interpretable clusters on the input graphs?\\n\\\\end{enumerate}\\n\\\\item[{\\\\bf Q1}] How does  \\\\name\\\\ compare to other pooling methods proposed for GNNs (e.g., using sort pooling~\\\\cite{zhang2018end} or the \\\\textsc{Set2Set} method \\\\cite{Gil+2017})?\\n\\\\item[{\\\\bf Q2}] How does  \\\\name\\\\ combined with GNNs compare to the state-of-the-art for graph classification task, including both GNNs and kernel-based methods?\\n\\\\item[{\\\\bf Q3}] Does  \\\\name  compute meaningful and interpretable clusters on the input graphs?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\\xhdr{Data sets}Data sets\\nTo probe the ability of \\\\name to learn complex hierarchical structures from graphs in different domains, we evaluate on a variety of relatively large graph data sets chosen from benchmarks commonly used in graph classification \\\\cite{KKMMN2016}.

Figure \\\\ref{fig:assignment_vis} shows such a visualization of node assignments in the first and second layers on a graph from \\\\textsc{Collab} data set, where node color indicates its cluster membership. Node cluster membership is determined by taking the $\\\\argmax$\\\\argmax of its cluster assignment probabilities. We observe that even when learning cluster assignment based solely on the graph classification objective, \\\\name can still capture the hierarchical community structure. We also observe significant improvement in membership assignment quality with link prediction auxiliary objectives.\\n\\n\\\\xhdr{Dense vs. sparse subgraph structure}Dense vs. sparse subgraph structure\\nIn addition, we observe that \\\\name learns to collapse nodes into soft clusters in a non-uniform way, with a tendency to collapse densely-connected subgraphs into clusters. \\nSince GNNs can efficiently perform message-passing on dense, clique-like subgraphs (due to their small diameters) \\\\cite{liao2018graph}, pooling together nodes in such a dense subgraph is not likely to lead to any loss of structural information. \\nThis intuitively explains why collapsing dense subgraphs is a useful pooling strategy for \\\\name. \\nIn contrast, sparse subgraphs may contain many interesting structures, including path-, cycle- and tree-like structures, and given the high-diameter induced by sparsity, GNN message-passing may fail to capture these structures. \\nThus, by separately pooling distinct parts of a sparse subgraph, \\\\name can learn to capture the meaningful structures present in sparse graph regions (e.g., as in Figure~\\\\ref{fig:assignment_vis}). \\n\\n\\\\xhdr{Assignment for nodes with similar representations}Assignment for nodes with similar representations\\nSince the assignment network computes the soft cluster assignment based on features of input nodes and their neighbors, nodes with both similar input features and neighborhood structure will have similar cluster assignment.\\nIn fact, one can construct synthetic cases where 2 nodes, although far away, have exactly the same neighborhood structure and features for self and all neighbors. In this case the pooling network is forced to assign them into the same cluster, which is different from the concept of pooling in other architectures such as image ConvNets. In some cases we do observe that disconnected nodes are pooled together.\\n\\nIn practice we rely on the identifiability assumption similar to Theorem 1 in GraphSAGE \\\\cite{hamilton2017inductive}, where nodes are identifiable via their features. This holds in many real datasets \\\\footnote{However, some chemistry molecular graph datasets contain many nodes that are structurally similar, and assignment network is observed to pool together nodes that are far away.}. \\nThe auxiliary link prediction objective is observed to also help discouraging nodes that are far away to be pooled together. Furthermore, it is possible to use more sophisticated GNN aggregation function such as high-order moments \\\\cite{verma2018graph} to distinguish nodes that are similar in structure and feature space. The overall framework remains unchanged.\\n\\n\\\\xhdr{Sensitivity of the Pre-defined Maximum Number of Clusters}Sensitivity of the Pre-defined Maximum Number of Clusters\\nWe found that the assignment varies according to the depth of the network and $C$C, the maximum number of clusters. With larger $C$C, the pooling GNN can model more complex hierarchical structure. The trade-off is that very large $C$C results in more noise and less efficiency. \\nAlthough the value of $C$C is a pre-defined parameter, the pooling net learns to use the appropriate number of clusters by end-to-end training. \\nIn particular, some clusters might not be used by the assignment matrix. Column corresponding to unused cluster has low values for all nodes. This is observed in Figure \\\\ref{fig:assignment_vis}(c), where nodes are assigned predominantly into 3 clusters.\\n\\n\\n\\\\cut{\\n\\\\xhdr{Number of clusters} \\\\jure{why is this in experiments?

When applying GNNs to graph classification, the standard approach is to generate embeddings for all the nodes in the graph and then to {\\\\em globally pool}\\\\em globally pool all these node embeddings together, e.g., using a simple summation or neural network that operates over sets \\\\cite{dai2016discriminative,Duv+2015,Gil+2017,Li+2016}. This global pooling approach ignores any hierarchical structure that might be present in the graph, and it prevents researchers from building effective GNN models for predictive tasks over entire graphs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere we propose \\\\name, a differentiable graph pooling module that can be adapted to various graph neural network architectures in an hierarchical and end-to-end fashion (Figure~\\\\ref{fig:illustration}). \\n\\\\name allows for developing deeper GNN models that can learn to operate on hierarchical representations of a graph. We develop a graph analogue of the spatial pooling operation in CNNs \\\\cite{krizhevsky2012imagenet}, which allows for deep CNN architectures to iteratively operate on coarser and coarser representations of an image. The challenge in the GNN setting---compared to standard CNNs---is that graphs contain no natural notion of spatial locality, i.e., one cannot simply pool together all nodes in a ``$m \\\\times m$m \\\\times m patch'' on a graph, because the complex topological structure of graphs precludes any straightforward, deterministic definition of a ``patch''. Moreover, unlike image data, graph data sets often contain graphs with varying numbers of nodes and edges, which makes defining a general graph pooling operator even more challenging.\\n\\nIn order to solve the above challenges, we require a model that learns how to cluster together nodes to build a hierarchical multi-layer scaffold on top of the underlying graph. \\nOur approach \\\\name learns a differentiable soft assignment at each layer of a deep GNN, mapping nodes to a set of clusters based on their learned embeddings. \\nIn this framework, we generate deep GNNs by ``stacking'' GNN layers in a hierarchical fashion (Figure~\\\\ref{fig:illustration}): the input nodes at the layer $l$l GNN module correspond to the clusters learned at the layer $l-1$l-1 GNN module. \\nThus, each layer of \\\\name coarsens the input graph more and more, and \\\\name is able to generate a hierarchical representation of any input graph after training.\\nWe show that \\\\name\\\\ can be combined with various GNN approaches, resulting in an average 7\\\\% gain in accuracy and a new state of the art on four out of five benchmark graph classification tasks. \\nFinally,  we show that \\\\name\\\\ can learn interpretable hierarchical clusters that correspond to well-defined communities in the input graphs.\\n\\\\cut{\\n\\\\jure{Say much much more about our method, how it works and why it is cool.}\\n\\n\\\\chris{Maybe add highlevel visualization of the idea.}\\n\\n\\\\jure{ I strongly agree, we need a Figure 1 with an illustration of the method.\\nFor example, a graph and then a hierarchical multi-layer scaffold on top of it.\\nWill, you are great at creating good figures.

1\\\\}^{n\\\\times n}n\\\\times n is the adjacency matrix, and $F \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n\\\\times d}$F \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n\\\\times d}n\\\\times d is the node feature matrix assuming each node has $d$d features.\\\\footnote{We do not consider edge features, although one can easily extend the algorithm to support edge features using techniques introduced in \\\\cite{simonovsky2017dynamic}.}\\nGiven a set of labeled graphs $\\\\mathcal{D}=\\\\{(G_1,y_1),(G_2,y_2),...\\\\}$\\\\mathcal{D}=\\\\{(G_1,y_1),(G_2,y_2),...\\\\} where $y_i \\\\in \\\\mathcal{Y}$y_i \\\\in \\\\mathcal{Y} is the label corresponding to graph $G_i \\\\in \\\\mathcal{G}$G_i \\\\in \\\\mathcal{G}, the goal of graph classification is to learn a mapping $f : \\\\mathcal{G} \\\\to \\\\mathcal{Y}$f : \\\\mathcal{G} \\\\to \\\\mathcal{Y} that maps graphs to the set of labels. \\nThe challenge---compared to standard supervised machine learning setup---is that we need a way to extract useful feature vectors from these input graphs.\\nThat is, in order to apply standard machine learning methods for classification, e.g., neural networks, we need a procedure to convert each graph to an finite dimensional vector in $\\\\mathbb{R}^D$\\\\mathbb{R}^D.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\\xhdr{Graph neural networks}Graph neural networks\\nIn this work, we build upon graph neural networks in order to learn useful representations for graph classification in an end-to-end fashion. \\nIn particular, we consider GNNs that employ the following general ``message-passing'' architecture:\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\\\label{eq:gnn}\\n     H^{(k)} = M(A,H^{(k-1)};\\\\theta^{(k)}),\\n\\\\end{equation}\\\\begin{equation}\\\\label{eq:gnn}\\n     H^{(k)} = M(A,H^{(k-1)};\\\\theta^{(k)}),\\n\\\\end{equation}\\\\label{eq:gnn}\\n     H^{(k)}(k) = M(A,H^{(k-1)}(k-1);\\\\theta^{(k)}(k)),\\n\\nwhere $H^{(k)} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n \\\\times d}$H^{(k)}(k) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n \\\\times d}n \\\\times d are the node embeddings (i.e., ``messages'') computed after $k$k steps of the GNN and $M$M is the message propagation function, which depends on the adjacency matrix, trainable parameters $\\\\theta^{(k)}$\\\\theta^{(k)}(k), and the node embeddings $H^{(k-1)}$H^{(k-1)}(k-1) generated from the previous message-passing step.\\\\footnote{For notational convenience, we assume that the embedding dimension is $d$ for all $H^{(k)}$; however, in general this restriction is not necessary.}\\nThe input node embeddings $H^{(0)}$H^{(0)}(0) at the initial message-passing iteration $(k=1)$(k=1), are initialized using\\nthe node features on the graph, $H^{(0)} = F$H^{(0)}(0) = F. \\n\\nThere are many possible implementations of the propagation function $M$M \\\\cite{Gil+2017,hamilton2017inductive}.\\nFor example, one popular variant of GNNs---Kipf's \\\\etal \\\\cite{kipf2017semi} Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)---implements $M$M using a combination of linear transformations and ReLU non-linearities:\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n    \\\\label{eq:gcn}\\n    H^{(k)} =  M(A,H^{(k-1)};W^{(k)}) = \\\\textrm{ReLU}(\\\\tilde{D}^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}}\\\\tilde{A}\\\\tilde{D}^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}} H^{(k-1)} W^{(k-1)}),\\n\\\\end{equation}\\\\begin{equation}\\n    \\\\label{eq:gcn}\\n    H^{(k)} =

M(A,H^{(k-1)}(k-1);W^{(k)}(k)) = \\\\textrm{ReLU}(\\\\tilde{D}^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}}-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\tilde{A}\\\\tilde{D}^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}}-\\\\frac{1}{2} H^{(k-1)}(k-1) W^{(k-1)}(k-1)),\\n\\nwhere $\\\\tilde{A}=A+I$\\\\tilde{A}=A+I, $\\\\tilde{D}=\\\\sum_j\\\\tilde{A}_{ij}$\\\\tilde{D}=\\\\sum_j\\\\tilde{A}_{ij}ij and $W^{(k)} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{d \\\\times d}$W^{(k)}(k) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{d \\\\times d}d \\\\times d is a trainable weight matrix.\\nThe differentiable pooling model we propose can be applied to any GNN model implementing Equation \\\\eqref{eq:gnn}, and is agnostic with regards to the specifics of how $M$M is implemented. \\n\\nA full GNN module will run $K$K iterations of Equation \\\\eqref{eq:gnn} to generate the final output node embeddings $Z=H^{(K)} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n \\\\times d}$Z=H^{(K)}(K) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n \\\\times d}n \\\\times d, where $K$K is usually in the range 2-6.\\nFor simplicity, in the following sections we will abstract away the internal structure of the GNNs and use $Z = \\\\gnn(A, X)$Z = \\\\gnn(A, X) to denote an arbitrary GNN module implementing $K$K iterations of message passing according to some adjacency matrix $A$A and initial input node features $X$X. \\n\\n\\\\xhdr{Stacking GNNs and pooling layers}Stacking GNNs and pooling layers\\nGNNs implementing Equation \\\\eqref{eq:gnn} are inherently flat, as they only propagate information across edges of a graph.\\nThe goal of this work is to define a general, end-to-end differentiable strategy that allows one to {\\\\em stack}\\\\em stack multiple GNN modules in a hierarchical fashion. \\nFormally, given $Z = \\\\gnn(A, X)$Z = \\\\gnn(A, X), the output of a GNN module, and a graph adjacency matrix $A \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n \\\\times n}$A \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n \\\\times n}n \\\\times n, we seek to define a strategy to output a new coarsened graph containing $m<n$m<n nodes, with weighted adjacency matrix $A^{'} \\\\in \\\\R^{m \\\\times m}$A^{'}' \\\\in \\\\R^{m \\\\times m}m \\\\times m and node embeddings $Z^{'} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{m\\\\times d}$Z^{'}' \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{m\\\\times d}m\\\\times d.\\nThis new coarsened graph can then be used as input to another GNN layer, and this whole process can be repeated $L$L times, generating a model with $L$L GNN layers that operate on a series of coarser and coarser versions of the input graph (Figure~\\\\ref{fig:illustration}).\\nThus, our goal is to learn how to cluster or pool together nodes using the output of a GNN, so that we can use this coarsened graph as input to another GNN layer.\\nWhat makes designing such a pooling layer for GNNs especially challenging---compared to the usual graph coarsening task---is that our goal is not to simply cluster the nodes in one graph, but to provide a general recipe to hierarchically pool nodes across a broad set of input graphs. \\nThat is, we need our model to learn a pooling strategy that will generalize across graphs with different nodes, edges, and that can adapt to the various graph structures during inference. \\n\\n\\\\cut{\\n\\\\chris{I think the paragraph below repeats some of the points of the prev. paragraph}\\nThe key challenge for graph pooling with GNNs is designing a pooling layer that respects the hierarchical structure of the input graph.\\nSimilar to how CNNs on images stack filters with increasingly large receptive fields, the pooling layers in a GNN should be stacked hierarchically, extracting coarser and coarser subgraph structures to allow the GNN to obtain a more global view of the graph at the final layers. \\n%Firstly, the pooling layer should respect the hierarchical structure of graph.\\n%In the context of ConvNets for images, a deep neural network is only effective if the architecture allows a larger and larger receptive field.\\n%Similarly, it is desirable to have graph pooling layers to be stacked hierarchically, extracting larger subgraph structures and allow GNN to obtain a more global view at higher level.\\n%At the same time, the pooling layer should retain the structural information of the graph.\\n%Intuitively, each pooling results in a more coarsened graph representation, where another layer of graph convolution can be applied.\\n%There are several key ingredients for an effective pooling strategy. \\n%Thus, in terms of graph structure, the pooling layer should effectively partition the graph into modular components . \\n%As a result, a good pooling strategy should generally comply with the property of homophily on graphs,\\n%\\\\emph{i.e.} the idea that nodes that are close to each other in graph should be pooled.\\nMoreover, what makes designing a pooling layer for GNNs especially challenging---compared to the

following this, we discuss how we generate the assignment matrix using a GNN architecture. \\n\\n\\\\xhdr{Pooling with an assignment matrix}Pooling with an assignment matrix\\nWe denote the learned cluster assignment matrix at layer $l$l as $S^{(l)} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n_l \\\\times n_{l+1}}$S^{(l)}(l) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n_l \\\\times n_{l+1}}n_l \\\\times n_{l+1}l+1. \\nEach row of $S^{(l)}$S^{(l)}(l) corresponds to one of the $n_l$n_l nodes (or clusters) at layer $l$l, and each column of $S^{(l)}$S^{(l)}(l) corresponds to one of the $n_{l+1}$n_{l+1}l+1 clusters at the next layer $l+1$l+1. \\nIntuitively, $S^{(l)}$S^{(l)}(l) provides a soft assignment of each node at layer $l$l to a cluster in the next coarsened layer $l+1$l+1.\\n\\nSuppose that $S^{(l)}$S^{(l)}(l) has already been computed, i.e., that we have computed the assignment matrix at the $l$l-th layer of our model.\\nWe denote the input adjacency matrix at this layer as $A^{(l)}$A^{(l)}(l) and denote the input node embedding matrix at this layer as $Z^{(l)}$Z^{(l)}(l).\\nGiven these inputs, the \\\\name layer $(A^{(l+1)},X^{(l+1)}) = \\\\textsc{DiffPool}(A^{(l)},Z^{(l)})$(A^{(l+1)}(l+1),X^{(l+1)}(l+1)) = \\\\textsc{DiffPool}(A^{(l)}(l),Z^{(l)}(l)) coarsens the input graph, generating a new coarsened adjacency matrix $A^{(l+1)}$A^{(l+1)}(l+1) and a new matrix of embeddings $X^{(l+1)}$X^{(l+1)}(l+1) for each of the nodes/clusters in this coarsened graph.\\nIn particular, we apply the two following equations:\\n\\\\begin{align}\\n\\\\label{eq:4}\\n&X^{(l+1)} = {S^{(l)}}^T Z^{(l)}\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n_{l+1} \\\\times d},\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\label{eq:5}\\n&A^{(l+1)} = {S^{(l)}}^T A^{(l)}{S^{(l)}} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n_{l+1} \\\\times n_{l+1}}.\\n\\\\end{align}\\\\begin{align}\\n\\\\label{eq:4}\\n&X^{(l+1)} = {S^{(l)}}^T Z^{(l)}\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n_{l+1} \\\\times d},\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\label{eq:5}\\n&A^{(l+1)} = {S^{(l)}}^T A^{(l)}{S^{(l)}} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n_{l+1} \\\\times n_{l+1}}.\\n\\\\end{align}\\n\\\\label{eq:4}\\n&X^{(l+1)}(l+1) = {S^{(l)}}S^{(l)}(l)^T Z^{(l)}(l)\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n_{l+1} \\\\times d}n_{l+1}l+1 \\\\times d,\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\label{eq:5}\\n&A^{(l+1)}(l+1) = {S^{(l)}}S^{(l)}(l)^T A^{(l)}(l){S^{(l)}}S^{(l)}(l) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n_{l+1} \\\\times n_{l+1}}n_{l+1}l+1 \\\\times n_{l+1}l+1.\\n\\nEquation \\\\eqref{eq:4} takes the node embeddings $Z^{(l)}$Z^{(l)}(l) and aggregates these embeddings according to the cluster assignments $S^{(l)}$S^{(l)}(l), generating embeddings for each of the $n_{l+1}$n_{l+1}l+1 clusters.\\nSimilarly, Equation \\\\eqref{eq:5} takes the adjacency matrix $A^{(l)}$A^{(l)}(l) and generates a coarsened adjacency matrix denoting the connectivity strength between each pair of clusters. \\n\\nThrough Equations \\\\eqref{eq:4} and \\\\eqref{eq:5}, the \\\\name layer coarsens the graph: the next layer adjacency matrix $A^{(l+1)}$A^{(l+1)}(l+1) represents a coarsened graph with $n_{l+1}$n_{l+1}l+1 nodes or {\\\\em cluster nodes}\\\\em cluster nodes, where each individual cluster node in the new coarsened graph corresponds to a cluster of nodes in the graph at layer $l$l.\\nNote that $A^{(l+1)}$A^{(l+1)}(l+1) is a real matrix and represents a fully connected edge-weighted  graph; each entry $A^{(l+1)}_{ij}$A^{(l+1)}(l+1)_{ij}ij can be viewed as the connectivity strength between cluster $i$i and cluster $j$j. \\nSimilarly, the $i$i-th row of $X^{(l+1)}$X^{(l+1)}(l+1) corresponds to the embedding of cluster $i$i. \\nTogether, the coarsened adjacency matrix $A^{(l+1)}$A^{(l+1)}(l+1) and cluster embeddings $X^{(l+1)}$X^{(l+1)}(l+1) can be used as input to another GNN layer, a process which we describe in detail below.  \\n\\n\\n\\\\xhdr{Learning the assignment matrix}Learning the assignment matrix\\nIn the following we describe the architecture of \\\\name, i.e., how \\\\name\\\\ generates the assignment matrix $S^{(l)}$S^{(l)}(l) and embedding matrices $Z^{(l)}$Z^{(l)}(l) that are used in Equations \\\\eqref{eq:4} and \\\\eqref{eq:5}.\\nWe generate these two matrices using two separate GNNs that are both applied to the input cluster node features $X^{(l)}$X^{(l)}(l) and coarsened adjacency matrix $A^{(l)}$A^{(l)}(l).\\nThe {\\\\em embedding GNN}\\\\em embedding GNN at layer $l$l is a standard GNN module applied to these inputs:\\n\\\\begin{align}\\\\label{eq:embedgnn}\\n   Z^{(l)} = \\\\gnn_{l, \\\\textrm{embed}}(A^{(l)}, X^{(l)}),\\n\\\\end{align}\\\\begin{align}\\\\label{eq:embedgnn}\\n   Z^{(l)} = \\\\gnn_{l, \\\\textrm{embed}}(A^{(l)}, X^{(l)}),\\n\\\\end{align}\\\\label{eq:embedgnn}\\n   Z^{(l)}(l) = \\\\gnn_{l, \\\\textrm{embed}}l, \\\\textrm{embed}(A^{(l)}(l), X^{(l)}(l)),\\n\\ni.e., we take the adjacency matrix between the cluster nodes at layer $l$l (from Equation \\\\ref{eq:5}) and the pooled features for the clusters (from Equation \\\\ref{eq:4}) and pass these matrices through a standard GNN to get new embeddings $Z^{(l)}$Z^{(l)}(l) for the cluster nodes. \\nIn contrast, the {\\\\em pooling GNN}\\\\em pooling GNN at layer $l$l, uses the input cluster features $X^{(l)}$X^{(l)}(l) and cluster adjacency matrix $A^{(l)}$A^{(l)}(l) to generate an assignment matrix:\\n\\\\begin{align}\\\\label{eq:poolgnn}\\n    S^{(l)} = \\\\textrm{softmax}\\\\left(\\\\gnn_{l,\\\\text{pool}}(A^{(l)}, X^{(l)})\\\\right),\\n\\\\end{align}\\\\begin{align}\\\\label{eq:poolgnn}\\n    S^{(l)} = \\\\textrm{softmax}\\\\left(\\\\gnn_{l,\\\\text{pool}}(A^{(l)}, X^{(l)})\\\\right),\\n\\\\end{align}\\\\label{eq:poolgnn}\\n    S^{(l)}(l) = \\\\textrm{softmax}\\\\left(\\\\gnn_{l,\\\\text{pool}}l,\\\\text{pool}(A^{(l)}(l), X^{(l)}(l))\\\\right),\\n\\nwhere the softmax function is applied in a row-wise fashion.\\nThe output dimension of $\\\\gnn_{l,\\\\text{pool}}$\\\\gnn_{l,\\\\text{pool}}l,\\\\text{pool} corresponds to a pre-defined maximum number of clusters in layer $l$l, and is a hyperparameter of the model.\\n\\nNote that these two GNNs consume the same input data but have distinct parameterizations and play separate roles:\\nThe embedding GNN generates new embeddings for the input nodes at this layer, while the pooling GNN generates a probabilistic assignment of the input nodes to $n_{l+1}$n_{l+1}l+1 clusters.\\n\\nIn the base case, the inputs to Equations \\\\eqref{eq:embedgnn} and Equations \\\\eqref{eq:poolgnn} at layer $l=0$l=0 are simply the input adjacency matrix $A$A and the node features $F$F for the original graph.\\nAt the penultimate layer $L-1$L-1 of a deep GNN model using \\\\name, we set the assignment matrix $S^{(L-1)}$S^{(L-1)}(L-1) be a vector of $1$1's, i.e., all nodes at the final layer $L$L are assigned to a single cluster, generating a final embedding vector corresponding to the entire graph.\\nThis final output embedding can then be used as feature input to a differentiable classifier (e.g., a softmax layer), and the entire system can be trained end-to-end using stochastic gradient descent. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\\xhdr{Permutation invariance}Permutation invariance\\nNote that in order to be useful for graph classification, the pooling layer should be invariant under node permutations.

In particular, the embedding matrix at each layer is used as an intermediate representations of nodes and subgraphs at different coarsening scales. In comparison, the assignment matrix at each layer is used to determine the clustering assignment, and determines which nodes and subgraphs should be pooled together. Therefore it is important to create asymmetry in the computation of both $S$ and $Z$, in order to differentiate their purposes. We achieve this in three ways.\\n\\n\\\\xhdr{Input Features}\\n\\\\note{note to rex himself: more experim - identity feat input?}\\nThe goal of $Z$ is to learn node and subgraph representations such that when pooled together, subsequent classifier can easily map the representations to labels. \\nSince the labels might be a complex function of all node features, e.g., homophily and structural properties of the input graph, we use a variety of features as inputs to $f_\\\\theta$ to compute $Z$, including structural features such as degree and clustering coefficient features, or node features.\\nIn comparison, the assignment network should learn to predict cluster indices mainly based on homophily property. Therefore structural features such as degree and clustering coefficients are removed from the input features, which is essential in obtaining meaningful clusters that also benefit the classification task.\\n\\n\\\\xhdr{Representation dimension}\\nAt deeper layers, the embedding matrix $Z$ provides representations for hyper-nodes corresponding to larger subgraphs. Therefore, more dimensions should be used when encoding larger subgraphs. This is analogous to CNNs for images~\\\\cite{?}, where the number of channels increases after each convolutional layer.  In contrast, the assignment matrix $S$ aims to map hyper-nodes into a fewer number of clusters, allowing hyper-nodes to gain a more global \\\\rex{what is better wording?} \\\\chris{higher-order?} view of connectivities between subgraphs. Therefore, at deeper layers, the output dimension of $g_\\\\phi$ decreases exponentially. Here the dimension reduction ratio $\\\\alpha$ is a hyper-parameter. In practice, we discover that performance is insensitive for $0.1 < \\\\alpha < 0.5$. The network outputs a sparse $S$ if the number of intuitive clusters are much less than the output dimension.\\n\\n\\\\xhdr{Auxiliary objectives}\\nControlling input features and representation dimension is still insufficient for $g_\\\\phi$ to learn and extract meaningful cluster information from a graph. We additionally supply side objectives as regularizations for $g_\\\\phi$. \\nIntuitively, $g_\\\\phi$ should learn to assign nodes that are close together in terms of connectivity into the same clusters. \\nHence, we use a link prediction objective to further encourage similarity of cluster assignments.\\nParticularly, at each layer $l$, we minimize\\n$L_{\\\\text{LP}} ||A^{(l)}, S^{(l)} S^{{(l)}^T}||_F$, where $||\\\\cdot||_F$ denotes the Frobinus norm. \\nNote that the (soft) adjacency matrix $A^{(l)}$ at deeper layers is a function of lower level assignment matrices, and changes during training. \\n\\nAnother important characteristic of $g_\\\\phi$ is that the output cluster assignment for each node should generally be close to a one-hot vector, so that the membership for each cluster or subgraph is clearly defined, except in rare cases where a node serves as a bridge between multiple clusters. We therefore regularize the entropy of the cluster assignment by minimizing $L_{\\\\text{E}} = \\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\sum_{i=1}^n H(S_i)$, where $H$ denotes the entropy function, and $S_i$ is the $i$-th row of $S$.\\n\\nDuring training, $L_{\\\\text{LP}}$ and $L_{\\\\text{E}}$ from each layer are added to the classification loss, in order to obtain meaningful assignment matrices at all layers. In practice we observe that training with the side objective takes longer to converge, but nevertheless achieves better performance and more interpretable cluster assignment.\\n\\n\\\\note{Note to Rex himself: try curriculum training}\\n\\\\chris{Where is $g_\\\\phi$ and $f_\\\\theta$ defined}\\n\\n\\\\xhdr{Relation to low rank matrix factorization}\\nWe note that by approximating $A$ with $S S^T$, the link prediction auxiliary objective bears close resemblance to a low rank matrix factorization of $A$, and well-separated pair decomposition (WSPD). \\nSimilar to matrix factorization, we require that at each layer, $S$ is able to capture most of the distance information between nodes, while using less dimensions than that of $A$. However, low rank matrix factorization is non-convex and has many local minimums. When trained end-to-end in the graph classification task, \\\\name tends to find local minimum that is better suited for the task. This explains our observation that DiffPool consistently out-performs a two-step procedure of graph clustering followed by GCN that pools over these clusters.\\n$\\\\mathrm{WSPD}$ computes small number of pairs of clusters, such that for any pair of points $(p, q)$, we can find a pair of clusters $(A, B)$ such that $p\\\\in A, q\\\\in B$, and $d(p, q) \\\\approx d(A, B)$. In the case of \\\\name, the goal of the auxiliary objective is to let the connectivity strength between any node pair $(p, q)$ to be reflected by the connectivity strength between their corresponding clusters. However, unlike WSPD, the assignment in \\\\name is soft to allow differentiability, which enables end-to-end training and avoids the high computation cost of WSPD in high dimensions.\\n\\n\\n\\\\xhdr{Behavior on sparse and dense networks}\\nThe sparsity of graphs also affects the behavior of the assignment network $g_\\\\phi$.\\nSuppose a subgraph of the input graph is dense, therefore the entries of the corresponding subgraph adjacency matrix are mostly ones. Since  $\\\\mathbf{1} \\\\mathbf{1}^T$ is a matrix of all ones, an assignment matrix for the subgraph, where one column is a vector of ones and the others are zero vectors, will be close to a minimum of the link prediction auxiliary objective.

Subsequently, each part of the subgraph should be assigned and pooled differently, to capture these meaningful structures. \\n\\n}\\n\\\\subsection{Learning to Pool with Side Information}\\n\\\\label{sec:pooling}\\n\\nAlthough the assignment matrix $S$S and the embedding matrix $Z$Z are both computed using the GCN architecture, they have distinct interpretations. In particular, the embedding matrix at each layer is used as an intermediate representations of nodes and subgraphs at different coarsening scales. In comparison, the assignment matrix at each layer is used to determine the clustering assignment, and determines which nodes and subgraphs should be pooled together. Therefore it is important to create asymmetry in the computation of both $S$S and $Z$Z, in order to differentiate their purposes. We achieve this in three ways.\\n\\n\\\\xhdr{Input Features}Input Features\\n\\\\note{note to rex himself: more experim - identity feat input?}note to rex himself: more experim - identity feat input?\\nThe goal of $Z$Z is to learn node and subgraph representations such that when pooled together, subsequent classifier can easily map the representations to labels. \\nSince the labels might be a complex function of all node features, e.g., homophily and structural properties of the input graph, we use a variety of features as inputs to $f_\\\\theta$f_\\\\theta to compute $Z$Z, including structural features such as degree and clustering coefficient features, or node features.\\nIn comparison, the assignment network should learn to predict cluster indices mainly based on homophily property. Therefore structural features such as degree and clustering coefficients are removed from the input features, which is essential in obtaining meaningful clusters that also benefit the classification task.\\n\\n\\\\xhdr{Representation dimension}Representation dimension\\nAt deeper layers, the embedding matrix $Z$Z provides representations for hyper-nodes corresponding to larger subgraphs. Therefore, more dimensions should be used when encoding larger subgraphs. This is analogous to CNNs for images~\\\\cite{?}, where the number of channels increases after each convolutional layer.  In contrast, the assignment matrix $S$S aims to map hyper-nodes into a fewer number of clusters, allowing hyper-nodes to gain a more global \\\\rex{what is better wording?}what is better wording? \\\\chris{higher-order?}higher-order? view of connectivities between subgraphs. Therefore, at deeper layers, the output dimension of $g_\\\\phi$g_\\\\phi decreases exponentially. Here the dimension reduction ratio $\\\\alpha$\\\\alpha is a hyper-parameter. In practice, we discover that performance is insensitive for $0.1 < \\\\alpha < 0.5$0.1 < \\\\alpha < 0.5. The network outputs a sparse $S$S if the number of intuitive clusters are much less than the output dimension.\\n\\n\\\\xhdr{Auxiliary objectives}Auxiliary objectives\\nControlling input features and representation dimension is still insufficient for $g_\\\\phi$g_\\\\phi to learn and extract meaningful cluster information from a graph. We additionally supply side objectives as regularizations for $g_\\\\phi$g_\\\\phi. \\nIntuitively, $g_\\\\phi$g_\\\\phi should learn to assign nodes that are close together in terms of connectivity into the same clusters. \\nHence, we use a link prediction objective to further encourage similarity of cluster assignments.\\nParticularly, at each layer $l$l, we minimize\\n$L_{\\\\text{LP}} ||A^{(l)}, S^{(l)} S^{{(l)}^T}||_F$L_{\\\\text{LP}}\\\\text{LP} ||A^{(l)}(l), S^{(l)}(l) S^{{(l)}^T}{(l)}(l)^T||_F, where $||\\\\cdot||_F$||\\\\cdot||_F denotes the Frobinus norm. \\nNote that the (soft) adjacency matrix $A^{(l)}$A^{(l)}(l) at deeper layers is a function of lower level assignment matrices, and changes during training. \\n\\nAnother important characteristic of $g_\\\\phi$g_\\\\phi is that the output cluster assignment for each node should generally be close to a one-hot vector, so that the membership for each cluster or subgraph is clearly defined, except in rare cases where a node serves as a bridge between multiple clusters. We therefore regularize the entropy of the cluster assignment by minimizing $L_{\\\\text{E}} = \\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\sum_{i=1}^n H(S_i)$L_{\\\\text{E}}\\\\text{E} = \\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\sum_{i=1}i=1^n H(S_i), where $H$H denotes the entropy function, and $S_i$S_i is the $i$i-th row of $S$S.\\n\\nDuring training, $L_{\\\\text{LP}}$L_{\\\\text{LP}}\\\\text{LP} and $L_{\\\\text{E}}$L_{\\\\text{E}}\\\\text{E} from each layer are added to the classification loss, in order to obtain meaningful assignment matrices at all layers. In practice we observe that training with the side objective takes longer to converge, but nevertheless achieves better performance and more interpretable cluster assignment.\\n\\n\\\\note{Note to Rex himself: try curriculum training}Note to Rex himself: try curriculum training\\n\\\\chris{Where is $g_\\\\phi$ and $f_\\\\theta$ defined}Where is $g_\\\\phi$g_\\\\phi and $f_\\\\theta$f_\\\\theta defined\\n\\n\\\\xhdr{Relation to low rank matrix factorization}Relation to low rank matrix factorization\\nWe note that by approximating $A$A with $S S^T$S S^T, the link prediction auxiliary objective bears close resemblance to a low rank matrix factorization of $A$A, and well-separated pair decomposition (WSPD). \\nSimilar to matrix factorization, we require that at each layer, $S$S is able to capture most of the distance information between nodes, while using less dimensions than that of $A$A. However, low rank matrix factorization is non-convex and has many local minimums. When trained end-to-end in the graph classification task, \\\\name tends to find local minimum that is better suited for the task. This explains our observation that DiffPool consistently out-performs a two-step procedure of graph clustering followed by GCN that pools over these clusters.\\n$\\\\mathrm{WSPD}$\\\\mathrm{WSPD} computes small number of pairs of clusters, such that for any pair of points $(p, q)$(p, q), we can find a pair of clusters $(A, B)$(A, B) such that $p\\\\in A, q\\\\in B$p\\\\in A, q\\\\in B, and $d(p, q) \\\\approx d(A, B)$d(p, q) \\\\approx d(A, B). In the case of \\\\name, the goal of the auxiliary objective is to let the connectivity strength between any node pair $(p, q)$(p, q) to be reflected by the connectivity strength between their corresponding clusters. However, unlike WSPD, the assignment in \\\\name is soft to allow differentiability, which enables end-to-end training and avoids the high computation cost of WSPD in high dimensions.\\n\\n\\n\\\\xhdr{Behavior on sparse and dense networks}Behavior on sparse and dense networks\\nThe sparsity of graphs also affects the behavior of the assignment network $g_\\\\phi$g_\\\\phi.\\nSuppose a subgraph of the input graph is dense, therefore the entries of the corresponding subgraph adjacency matrix are mostly ones. Since  $\\\\mathbf{1} \\\\mathbf{1}^T$\\\\mathbf{1} \\\\mathbf{1}^T is a matrix of all ones, an assignment matrix for the subgraph, where one column is a vector of ones and the others are zero vectors, will be close to a minimum of the link prediction auxiliary objective.

Figure \\\\ref{fig:assignment_vis} shows such a visualization of node assignments in the first and second layers on a graph from \\\\textsc{Collab} data set, where node color indicates its cluster membership. Node cluster membership is determined by taking the $\\\\argmax$\\\\argmax of its cluster assignment probabilities. We observe that even when learning cluster assignment based solely on the graph classification objective, \\\\name can still capture the hierarchical community structure. We also observe significant improvement in membership assignment quality with link prediction auxiliary objectives.\\n\\n\\\\xhdr{Dense vs. sparse subgraph structure}Dense vs. sparse subgraph structure\\nIn addition, we observe that \\\\name learns to collapse nodes into soft clusters in a non-uniform way, with a tendency to collapse densely-connected subgraphs into clusters. \\nSince GNNs can efficiently perform message-passing on dense, clique-like subgraphs (due to their small diameters) \\\\cite{liao2018graph}, pooling together nodes in such a dense subgraph is not likely to lead to any loss of structural information. \\nThis intuitively explains why collapsing dense subgraphs is a useful pooling strategy for \\\\name. \\nIn contrast, sparse subgraphs may contain many interesting structures, including path-, cycle- and tree-like structures, and given the high-diameter induced by sparsity, GNN message-passing may fail to capture these structures. \\nThus, by separately pooling distinct parts of a sparse subgraph, \\\\name can learn to capture the meaningful structures present in sparse graph regions (e.g., as in Figure~\\\\ref{fig:assignment_vis}). \\n\\n\\\\xhdr{Assignment for nodes with similar representations}Assignment for nodes with similar representations\\nSince the assignment network computes the soft cluster assignment based on features of input nodes and their neighbors, nodes with both similar input features and neighborhood structure will have similar cluster assignment.\\nIn fact, one can construct synthetic cases where 2 nodes, although far away, have exactly the same neighborhood structure and features for self and all neighbors. In this case the pooling network is forced to assign them into the same cluster, which is different from the concept of pooling in other architectures such as image ConvNets. In some cases we do observe that disconnected nodes are pooled together.\\n\\nIn practice we rely on the identifiability assumption similar to Theorem 1 in GraphSAGE \\\\cite{hamilton2017inductive}, where nodes are identifiable via their features. This holds in many real datasets \\\\footnote{However, some chemistry molecular graph datasets contain many nodes that are structurally similar, and assignment network is observed to pool together nodes that are far away.}. \\nThe auxiliary link prediction objective is observed to also help discouraging nodes that are far away to be pooled together. Furthermore, it is possible to use more sophisticated GNN aggregation function such as high-order moments \\\\cite{verma2018graph} to distinguish nodes that are similar in structure and feature space. The overall framework remains unchanged.\\n\\n\\\\xhdr{Sensitivity of the Pre-defined Maximum Number of Clusters}Sensitivity of the Pre-defined Maximum Number of Clusters\\nWe found that the assignment varies according to the depth of the network and $C$C, the maximum number of clusters. With larger $C$C, the pooling GNN can model more complex hierarchical structure. The trade-off is that very large $C$C results in more noise and less efficiency. \\nAlthough the value of $C$C is a pre-defined parameter, the pooling net learns to use the appropriate number of clusters by end-to-end training. \\nIn particular, some clusters might not be used by the assignment matrix. Column corresponding to unused cluster has low values for all nodes. This is observed in Figure \\\\ref{fig:assignment_vis}(c), where nodes are assigned predominantly into 3 clusters.\\n\\n\\n\\\\cut{\\n\\\\xhdr{Number of clusters} \\\\jure{why is this in experiments?
