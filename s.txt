An ideal codec for speech language models should not only preserve\\nacoustic information but also capture rich semantic information. However,\\nexisting speech codecs struggle to balance high-quality audio reconstruction\\nwith ease of modeling by language models. In this study, we analyze the\\nlimitations of previous codecs in balancing semantic richness and acoustic\\nfidelity. We propose XY-Tokenizer, a novel codec that mitigates the conflict\\nbetween semantic and acoustic capabilities through multi-stage, multi-task\\nlearning. Experimental results demonstrate that XY-Tokenizer achieves\\nperformance in both semantic and acoustic tasks comparable to that of\\nstate-of-the-art codecs operating at similar bitrates, even though those\\nexisting codecs typically excel in only one aspect. Specifically, XY-Tokenizer\\nachieves strong text alignment, surpassing distillation-based semantic modeling\\nmethods such as SpeechTokenizer and Mimi, while maintaining a speaker\\nsimilarity score of 0.83 between reconstructed and original audio. The\\nreconstruction performance of XY-Tokenizer is comparable to that of BigCodec,\\nthe current state-of-the-art among acoustic-only codecs, which achieves a\\nspeaker similarity score of 0.84 at a similar bitrate.

To address these issues, we propose MoCa, a two-stage\nframework for transforming pre-trained VLMs into effective bidirectional\nmultimodal embedding models.

Key advantages of CLoVE over existing CFL algorithms are (1) its\\nsimplicity, (2) its applicability to both supervised and unsupervised settings,\\nand (3) the fact that it eliminates the need for near-optimal model\\ninitialization, which makes it more robust and better suited for real-world\\napplications. We establish theoretical convergence bounds, showing that CLoVE\\ncan recover clusters accurately with high probability in a single round and\\nconverges exponentially fast to optimal models in a linear setting. Our\\ncomprehensive experiments comparing with a variety of both CFL and generic\\nPersonalized Federated Learning (PFL) algorithms on different types of datasets\\nand an extensive array of non-IID settings demonstrate that CLoVE achieves\\nhighly accurate cluster recovery in just a few rounds of training, along with\\nstate-of-the-art model accuracy, across a variety of both supervised and\\nunsupervised PFL tasks.', 'authors': ['Randeep Bhatia', 'Nikos Papadis', 'Murali Kodialam', 'TV Lakshman', 'Sayak Chakrabarty'], 'published': '2025-06-27T17:52:16+00:00', 'categories': ['cs.LG', 'cs.AI'], 'url': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22427v1'}"}, {'id': 196, 'arxiv_id': '2506.22419v1', 'base_arxiv_id': '2506.22419', 'version': '1', 'title': 'The Automated LLM Speedrunning Benchmark: Reproducing NanoGPT Improvements', 'abstract': 'Rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have the potential to\nassist in scientific progress.
