# Supplementary Materials: Academic Paper Datasets

## Overview

This supplementary material contains two academic datasets along with the code infrastructure used to construct and process them:

1. **OpenReview Dataset** - Papers and reviews from ICLR 2025 Conference
2. **ArXiv Dataset** - Academic papers from arXiv.org preprint repository

These datasets serve as the foundation for our research on [your research topic - e.g., academic paper analysis, review prediction, citation network analysis, etc.].

## Dataset Description

The supplementary materials include two datasets:

### OpenReview Dataset (ICLR 2025)

1. **openreview_papers.csv** - Paper metadata including titles, abstracts, decisions, and PDF links
2. **openreview_authors.csv** - Author profiles from the venue **(contains author names)**
3. **openreview_papers_authors.csv** - Mapping between papers and their authors **(links papers to authors)**
4. **openreview_reviews.csv** - Review content with ratings and feedback

14. **paragraph_figures_sample.csv** - Figure references within paragraphs
15. **paragraph_references_sample.csv** - Bibliography references within paragraphs
16. **paragraph_tables_sample.csv** - Table references within paragraphs

### Code Files

The repository includes two implementations for data processing:

- **CSV Implementation** (`csv_openreview_*.py`) - Pandas-based data processing
- **SQL Implementation** (`sql_openreview_*.py`) - PostgreSQL database backend
- **Utility Modules** - OpenReview API crawler and PDF processing utilities

## Double-Blind Compliance Statement

**IMPORTANT: These datasets contain publicly available data from academic sources and do NOT include any papers authored by the submission authors.**

### Author Information in Datasets

Some files in these datasets contain author information (names, affiliations, profiles) as part of the publicly available academic data:

**OpenReview Dataset:**
- `openreview_authors.csv` - Contains author names, emails, affiliations, and profile links
- `openreview_papers_authors.csv` - Maps papers to authors

**ArXiv Dataset:**
- `authors_sample.csv` - Contains author names, Semantic Scholar IDs, and homepage links  
- `paper_authors_sample.csv` - Maps papers to authors
- `citations_sample.csv` - Contains author names in citation metadata

### Double-Blind Policy Compliance

This supplementary material complies with double-blind review policies because:

1. **No submission author papers are included** - None of the papers in either dataset are authored by the submission authors or their close collaborators

2. **Publicly available data** - All data is sourced from public platforms:
   - OpenReview.net - a public peer review platform
   - arXiv.org - a public preprint repository
   - Semantic Scholar - a public academic search engine

3. **Dataset as research subject** - The author information is part of the publicly available datasets being studied, similar to citing papers in a bibliography. These are not the submission authors' identities but rather the subjects of our research analysis.

4. **No identifying selection bias** - The dataset selection does not reveal the submission authors' identity through:
   - Paper topic choices
   - Institutional concentration  
   - Citation patterns
   - Temporal clustering

5. **Option to provide anonymized versions** - If requested by reviewers, we can provide versions of these datasets with author names removed, retaining only anonymized IDs for structural analysis.

### What Reviewers Should Know

The presence of author names in files like `openreview_authors.csv`, `authors_sample.csv`, and `paper_authors_sample.csv` represents the academic community whose work we are studying - NOT the identities of the submission authors. This is analogous to a paper on citation network analysis including the names of researchers in the citation network being studied.

**For verification purposes:** We confirm that a thorough check has been conducted to ensure that:
- ✓ No papers by the submission authors appear in these datasets
- ✓ No papers by close collaborators of the submission authors appear in these datasets  
- ✓ The dataset selection does not create identifying patterns
- ✓ All data is from publicly accessible sources

## Data Sources and Collection

### OpenReview Dataset
- **Source**: OpenReview.net (https://openreview.net/)
- **Venue**: ICLR 2025 Conference (ICLR.cc/2025/Conference)
- **Collection Method**: OpenReview public API
- **Data Status**: All data represents publicly visible submissions and reviews

### ArXiv Dataset  
- **Source**: arXiv.org (https://arxiv.org/) and Semantic Scholar API
- **Collection Method**: arXiv API and Semantic Scholar API
- **Data Status**: All data represents publicly available preprints and metadata

Both datasets contain only publicly accessible information that is freely available to any researcher.

## Ethical Considerations

- All data is publicly available from OpenReview.net and arXiv.org
- Author information is included as part of the research dataset (subjects of study, not submission authors)
- No private or confidential information is included
- Reviewer anonymity is preserved through pseudonyms (OpenReview data)
- Dataset complies with OpenReview's and arXiv's terms of service
- All author names, affiliations, and profiles are publicly accessible metadata from these platforms

### Handling of Author Information

The files containing author information (`openreview_authors.csv`, `authors_sample.csv`, `paper_authors_sample.csv`, `citations_sample.csv`) include publicly available metadata that:

1. **Is already public** - Available to anyone accessing OpenReview.net or arXiv.org
2. **Serves research purposes** - Necessary for citation analysis, collaboration network studies, or authorship attribution research
3. **Does not identify submission authors** - Represents the academic community being studied, not the paper authors
4. **Can be anonymized if needed** - We can provide versions with author names replaced by anonymized IDs upon reviewer request

## Data Availability

The complete dataset and code will be made publicly available upon paper acceptance to facilitate reproducibility and future research.

## Contact

For questions about this dataset or supplementary materials, please refer to the main paper submission or contact the conference organizers through the official review system.

**Note to Reviewers**: This supplementary material is provided to demonstrate our data collection and processing methodology. The presence of author names in certain files (marked above with **(contains author names)** or **(publicly available metadata)**) represents the academic community whose work we are studying - NOT the identities of the submission authors. This is analogous to including author names in a citation network analysis or bibliometric study.

**Key Point**: Just as a meta-analysis paper about machine learning research would cite papers by named authors without violating anonymity, our datasets include publicly available author metadata as the subject of our research, not as identification of the submission authors.

**Verification**: We have thoroughly verified that:
- No papers in these datasets are authored by the submission authors
- No papers by close collaborators are included
- The dataset selection does not create identifying patterns
- All data sources are publicly accessible

If reviewers prefer, we can provide anonymized versions of the author-containing files with names replaced by numeric identifiers.
